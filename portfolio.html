          <pre class="copy">Most women are living their lives wrong…

You see:

There’s a reason why there are 14-year-olds making thousands each day,

While you’re making less than $10k/mo while working long hours at your day jobs.

It’s because these young children have discovered something that most adults will never realize…

The internet gives everyone an equal chance to make money online no matter where you are in life.

For example,

English isn’t my first language,

I dropped out of college in my second year,

And I’m a woman.

But despite this,

I was able to start a side hustle that profits 7 figures each year.

I call it the “Automated Income AI System”,

And it works by creating and selling your own digital products online.

Now, if you’re still watching this Ad,

You’re probably serious about making a lot of girl money online.

So at this point,

You need to make a decision.

You can either go to college for 4 years just to work at a 9-5 you’re probably going to hate.

OR

Hustle for 2 years to make a 7-figure income working 3 hours per day.

If you chose the second option,

My 5-step roadmap to build an “Automated Income AI System” will help you achieve those goals.

It has all the information I wish I had when first starting this side hustle.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

With this guide, you’ll know how to finally quit your 9-5 and get the attention and money you deserve.

Are you tired of working at your unfulfilling 9-5 job?

Taking on extra projects, working unpaid overtime, not using your vacation days,

But despite all that hard work you’re putting in,

You’re not getting the credit or pay that you deserve.

If you feel like this,

Then I can help you out.

My name’s Hannah,

And I help women make an extra $1k+/day in passive income with just a lunch break's worth of work,

So they can finally start living their best girly lives.

With the AI business model that I teach,

I’ve generated over seven figures in profit over the last two years.

With that extra money and freedom,

I’ve been able to move to Dubai, travel to over 20 countries, and see my friends almost every day.

And now, I want to help you do the same.

That’s why I’m giving you a 5-step income system roadmap.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

‘I’m so happy another man bought me this car.

I could never buy a car like this because I’ve never worked a day in my life.’

Many people believe this is what I’m thinking each day,

But it’s not true.

I bought all my cars, houses, and luxury trips with my hard-earned money.

How?

Well, I used to work at a 9-5 while only making $6k/mo,

But started a unique side hustle a little under 2 years ago,

And I’ve scaled it to make me over $100k/mo.

And no,

I didn’t start a clothing brand or become an affiliate marketer,

And I never had to take off a single piece of clothing.

This side hustle is called AI income automation,

And you create and sell your own digital products.

This means you’ll never have to worry about stocking inventory or having good profit margins.

And with the help of AI,

90% of the process is automated,

So you can make all this money while barely working 2 hours per day.

So how can you get started?

Well, it took me 6 months to start making $30k/mo,

But I’ve seen people scale to that income in just 3 months.

To help you make $1k/mo+ in passive income in as little time as possible,

I created a 5-step income system roadmap.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

          <pre class="copy">Attention fitness coaches…

If you’re struggling to find qualified leads,

Then this funnel might be one of the best solutions going into 2025.

It’s called the “AR” funnel.

And it has helped over 500 fitness coaches make an additional $20k/mo from the extra customers.

The funnel works by attracting ready-to-buy leads for your business,

And ultimately get a recurring subscription so large that you may not need to run Ads to make money.

Best of all, it’s a fully automatic done-for-you funnel that can be installed for just a one-time payment.

If you’d like our help to install the “AR” funnel into your fitness business to help you attract more qualified leads,

This is the perfect opportunity going into the New Year.

More people are setting fitness goals,

Deciding to finally get in shape,

And looking into buying fitness programs.

So this is the best time to optimize your lead-generation system.

No other time in the year has more people looking to invest in fitness coaches than now.

So don’t miss out on the value this funnel can provide.

          <pre class="copy">If you’re a fitness coach looking to make more money,

Then this video is for you.

There’s a system fitness coaches are using to make 10-20% more revenue each month.

And they don’t need to search for new leads,

Increase their prices,

Or buy premade lead lists.

In fact, once this system is installed in a fitness business,

The owner can generate income without even lifting a finger.

And that is…

A referral system.

Yes, this is what thousands of personal trainers are currently sleeping on.

Think about it…

You trust your friends and family,

So if they recommend a personal trainer,

You’ll take their word for it because you know they have good intentions for you.

These referrals are more often qualified leads ready to invest in themselves.

A referral system can create additional revenue while having low maintenance.

And that’s why I made it the main priority to include in my “AR” funnel.

It’s a fully DFY sales funnel to not only attract more qualified leads,

But it also includes a referral system to potentially increase your MRR by 10-20%.

You can get all this for a one-time payment.

So if you’re ready to see if the “AR” funnel is a right fit based on your specific business,

We’ll analyze your business’s current situation,

Give you advice to scale based on where you’re at,

And see if the “AR” funnel and its referral system are the perfect fit for you.</pre>

          </div>
          <pre class="copy">Did you know that 80% of fitness businesses fail in the first 2 years?

This usually happens for 3 main reasons:

The brands are running ads that barely break even,

The business is struggling to find leads who actually want to invest in their services,

And they rely on cold outreach and inconsistent ad campaigns to survive.

But what if you didn’t have to?

What if you could consistently attract high-paying clients without spending a dime on ads?

That’s where the “AR” funnel comes in.

For just a one-time payment,

This done-for-you system is designed not only to bring in qualified leads,

But also to create a referral network that grows your revenue every single month.

Think about it…

People are more likely to listen to those whom they know, like, and trust.

For this reason,

Acquiring leads through references is much easier than targeting strangers on the internet.

This makes these referral leads easier to close,

More likely to stick around,

And they don’t cost you anything to acquire.

The best part?

The “AR” funnel automates the entire process,

So it takes care of the entire system once installed.

The funnel has already helped over 500 fitness coaches make an extra $20k/mo,

And it may be able to help you too.

Preview Text: Not what you think…

%FIRSTNAME%,

If you’re not a modern sheik in today’s world,

And you’re not dating at least 4 women at once…

Then what are you doing?

Now, I might sound like a misogynist when I say that,

But hear me out.

These 4 girlfriends that you have shouldn’t exist in real life,
But rather your imagination.

What do I mean by this?
Acting like you're dating four girls will solve many of your needy problems.

Think about it:
If you were dating 4 women,
Would you care if one of them didn’t text you back or cancelled plans at the last minute?
Would it be a big deal if one of the relationships didn’t work out?

Chances are you wouldn’t be too upset because you’d have other options.

When you don’t put all your faith into one person,
You’ll seem less needy and more confident,
Which will make you more attractive to the woman you’re dating.

So %FIRSTNAME%,
Next time you feel a certain way about a girl,
Then just ask yourself…
‘Would I feel this way if I had 4 girlfriends?’

If the answer is no,
Then it means you’re being needy and need to change your behavior.

Now, you may be wondering:
‘This all sounds good,
But what can I do not to act desperate?’

Well, if that’s the case,
I’ve taught hundreds of men the blueprint not to be needy.

In 12 weeks, they’ve gone from struggling to attract women,
To thrive in their romantic relationships.

If you’d like access to this framework,
Reply to this email with the word “FOUR”,
And I’ll send it over to you.

Your friend,
&lt;name&gt;.</pre>

Preview Text: Here’s how…

It’s true %FIRSTNAME%,
The ugly baby concept is preventing IG growth.

And it’s not for the reason you think.

I know, the name might sound weird,
But hear me out.

The idea refers to when a creator thinks their work is high-quality,
But a viewer thinks it’s terrible.

It’s the same reason why a toddler thinks he drew the next Mona Lisa
even though he just scribbled all over the paper.

As creators,
We know how much effort we put into the content,
So we’re biased to thinking the reels are better than they actually are.

This is why we may spend 5 hours creating a reel,
Only for it to get 11 likes.

Now %FIRSTNAME%,
I’ve found that the best way to prevent this from happening…
To have an expert to critique your content.

Not only can they provide unbiased feedback,

Preview Text: Not what you think…

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

It was December 25, 2006.
I checked my mailbox and saw that I’d gotten a Christmas card from my dentist.

The message read “Happy Holidays, brush twice a day, floss regularly!”

Why am I telling you this?

Many of your conversations with women are like my dentist's Christmas card:
Boring, generic, and templated.

Do you think you’ll create an unforgettable impression by saying…
“I like your outfit.”
“What do you do for work?”
“The weather’s nice today.”

The truth is…
She’ll see you as just another random guy with no personality.

That’s why when you speak to a woman,
You should focus more on making her emotional.

Crack a witty joke,
Playfully tease her,
You could even tell her she’s fatter than the sun.
(Although I don’t recommend that 😂)

So next time you speak to a woman,
Don't be like my dentist's Christmas card.

Invoke strong emotions,
And she’ll get hooked to you.

Now with all that being said,
I have to make an important disclaimer…

Although the exact phrases you say to her are important,
They alone won’t make her feel emotional.

You need to have open body language,
Master small talk to avoid having dry conversations,
And know how to have good conversations over text.

That’s why in my 3-month coaching program,
You’ll not only learn how to speak to women to become a walking chick magnet,
But you’ll also get access to
My fiercely guarded PREMIUM seduction secrets to become irresistibly attractive to women.
Exclusive coaching calls to learn texting basics, bedroom mastery, and everything in between.
Access to my Brotherhood Facebook group to get so many dates you can’t fit them all on your calendar.

As a bonus,
If you haven’t been on any dates after the 3 months,
You can stay in the program for FREE until you do.

Click here to apply for your 1:1 breakthrough session.

Because it’s Christmas time,
There’s going to be a huge discount.

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Regardless of who you wanted to win the presidential election,
You were likely bombarded with automated texts promoting a specific candidate.

But despite being irritating,
The messages teach an important lesson on how NOT to build a brand on IG.

Think about it…
Did you enjoy seeing those spammy unpersonalized messages?

You probably just ignored them, and for good reason.

The thing is %FIRSTNAME%…
People hate being sold to.

Ads are so common nowadays.
You’re probably tired of seeing them in every corner of the internet.

That’s why people more than ever before crave genuine and approachable brands,
As opposed to ones that are constantly hard-selling.

To make sure your brand falls into the first category,
You need to do the following:
Be authentic and share your personality so your target audience can easily connect with you.
Make the content engaging so people look forward to your posts.
Give actionable value so your audience sees you as the go-to authority in your niche.

By implementing these tips,
Your content will engage your target audience better.

Preview Text: 8 years of dating experience inside

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Do you tend to stay home and keep to a small circle of friends?
If so, you’re just like me when I was 20.

I would play video games all day without talking to anyone.
I was so shy that my hands used to shake uncontrollably whenever I’d talk to women.

Every time I’d talk to one at the grocery store,
I’d have a nervous breakdown and stutter and look like an idiot.

It got to the point where even going out in public was hard sometimes.
I didn’t know if I’d ever be able to get rid of my social anxiety.

But after a few months, just by implementing 3 new habits,
I found that I was not only able to overcome my social anxiety,
But also turn on my ‘extrovert switch’ whenever necessary.

Here are 3 things I did to overcome my social anxiety about talking to women.

1. Say ‘yes’ whenever you’re invited somewhere.
Even if the activity bored me to tears,
I’d show up to get more chances to leave the house and talk to people.

Women can sense if you haven’t talked to anyone in months,
So give yourself as many opportunities to socialize as possible.

2. Leave your house for at least 20-30 minutes every day.
It doesn’t matter where you go as long as you talk to everyone you see.

I started doing this when I was 20,
And I’m still consistent with it at 28 years old.

I just make simple comments like…
“Hey, how’s your day going?”
“I like your glasses.”
“You have a cool outfit.”

Regularly talking to everybody will make you more comfortable around women.

3. Go to a nightlife venue at least once per week.
Stay sober the entire time and talk to as many people as possible.

It might feel uncomfortable being around drunk people,
But if you drop any judgment, you’ll enjoy yourself more.

Use what I call the ‘anti-drunk method’.
Drunk people don’t care what others think,
So you need to do the same.

Once you start letting loose while speaking,
You’ll come off as more likable.

Those are 3 life-changing habits you can apply to your daily life.

Even though I don’t have difficulties talking to women anymore,
I still follow these habits because they help me feel more confident,
And I’m sure they’ll help you too.

Rooting for you.

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

If you’re an ecom business owner,
Then you may have been using...

Interest-based targeting,

Or custom audiences to target on Facebook Ads,

If so, then listen closely to what I’m about to tell you…

STOP IT.

Even though it’s what most gurus are preaching,
These targeting methods are outdated.

When I switched to the opposite approach,
My store went from making 140k/mo to 783k/mo in just 8 months.

You can find the details in my newest YouTube video.

In it, I go over:
The targeting shift I made to 5.5x my income and how you can use it too.
How I target ads to over 150 million people with this new method, while simultaneously reaching the ideal audience.
How I take advantage of the Facebook algorithm to show more ads to engage audiences and maximize ad spend.

Preview Text: Here’s what I mean…

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

If you offer coaching, consulting, or run a DFY agency,
Then you’re probably familiar with the following…

Cold calling for 3 hours without reaching a single interested prospect.
Sending 2000 emails without finding any warm leads.
Paying thousands for a course only for it to be filled with generic templates.

These experiences aren’t enjoyable for most people.
You usually need to spend days outreaching before seeing results.

But I spoke to my friend Adam recently,
And he came up with a new way to get qualified leads for his agency.

He calls his new method the “2-step Webinar Cracker”,
And he got 35% of his contacts to join his agency as a result of it.

He’s also taught hundreds of other people how to use this framework,
And many of them have hit their first 30k, 50k, and even 100k+ month because of it.

Unlike other ‘gurus’ who may charge 15k for their frameworks,
Adam and I will be showing you how this method works in a F.R.E.E. 2-day live event.

The event will take place December 10-11 from 7-10 pm EST on both days.


Stay scaling,
&lt;name&gt;.

P.S. Don’t worry, we won’t be selling you any courses during the event.
P.P.S. The meeting room can only fit up to 30 people.

I even lost 8k in 2021 because of this error.

I didn’t offer a guarantee in my deal.

But believe it or not,
The marriage taught me an important lesson about outreaching to creative clients.

If I asked her to marry me the moment I saw her,
She probably would’ve walked away and never spoken to me again 😂.

The same principle applies to your creative business.

So many business owners ask the prospects to hire them before introducing themselves…

That’s like asking them to marry you without even getting on a call with them.

You just need to follow the “Date 2 Marry method”.

    I knew I didn’t want to go to college.
    
    I told my family that I was going to become a YouTuber.

    It took me 2 years to make my first $5k online.
    
    During that time, all my family members and friends seriously doubted my ability to succeed.
    
    “Just quit, it’ll never work.”
    “Why do you keep trying? You haven’t gotten anywhere.”

    It may be because of this 1 big mistake I see many men make.
    
    [In this part, &lt;name&gt; wears a backward cap and acts like a guy swiping on an app.]
    
    “She’s an accountant?
    Nah, she’s probably boring.
    
    She’s wearing a cross in a photo?
    I’ll pass, I don’t want to date someone who’s extremely religious.
    
    She has a photo of herself on a farm?
    No thank you, I prefer to live in the city, so the relationship probably won’t work out.”
    
    [Back to being &lt;name&gt;.]
    
    Stop.
    
    Dating apps only show a tiny part of someone’s personality.
    
    You can’t know everything about a person just by looking at a couple of photos.
    
    Here’s the truth:
    
    That accountant you thought would be boring could be one of the funniest, most adventurous people you ever met.
    
    That girl wearing the cross might not be religious.
    She may just be wearing it because her family does.
    
    And that woman on the farm could’ve just been visiting the place.
    She may like the city just as much as you do.
    
    The point is…
    
    You should avoid swiping solely based on surface-level judgments.
    
    Remove the filters,
    Have an open mind when you swipe on the apps.
    
    And you’ll be amazed at the people you might meet.
    
    But wait…
    
    Before you start swiping,
    You should know that having an open mind alone won’t get you dates.
    
    If the pictures on your profile don’t stand out,
    You don’t know what openers to send,
    Or you can’t turn texts into real-life dates,
    Then you probably won’t have much success on the apps.
    
    So if you’d like to learn all my dating app secrets to turn your profile into a woman magnet,
    
    Comment the word “SWIPE” and I’ll send you my free guide to master dating apps in 2025.</pre>

The only reason I was able to ride this camel?

Because I defied all those around me.

When I graduated high school,
I knew I didn’t want to go to college.
I told my family that I was going to become a YouTuber.
They all laughed at the idea, but I didn’t care.

It took me 2 years to make my first $5k online.
During that time, all my family members and friends seriously doubted my ability to succeed.

“Just quit, it’ll never work.”
“Why do you keep trying? You haven’t gotten anywhere.”

But I refused to listen to anybody who was trying to discourage me.

And 5 years later,
I now run 12 faceless AI YouTube channels, bringing in over $150k/mo.

So whatever your values are,
Stick to them,
And don’t let anyone else discourage you from following your dream.

        <pre class="copy">[image relaxing on the beach]

They told me going to college was the safe option for a good life,
but did it turn out that way?

I tried dropshipping while pursuing a finance major…
I didn’t get many results…
so I quit and got a “real job”.

But I was miserable.

Having to go into the office every day…
surrounded by four blank walls…
staring at a computer screen…
I felt like my soul was being sucked out of my body.

This changed during one summer week.

A friend had a wedding in Paris,
but my boss wouldn’t let me take the days off.

That was the breaking point.

In the next month,
I put in my 2 weeks' notice,
moved to Barcelona,
got a 9-5 retail job,
and restarted dropshipping.

The result after 2 years?

I’m able to enjoy a sunny afternoon surfing the waves without worrying about money.

Sometimes, all it takes is a single moment to change your life,
one where you say:
‘I’m going to change my life,
and I won’t stop until I’m successful.’

So that was my story,
but now, I want to know more about you.

Comment what goals you’re currently working on👇.
I’d love to hear them.

    By the end of this training, you’ll know the 3-step “VCP” framework:
    1) Visibility — reach the most people in the least time
    2) Consumability — keep viewers watching + build KLT (know/like/trust)
    3) Profitability — monetize on autopilot beyond AdSense
    
    WHO AM I? (Authority + Relatability)
    My name is &lt;name&gt;… I grew my channel to $100k/mo in passive income…

    The 6 biggest mistakes to AVOID as a new language learner
    
    INTRO
    “I’ve learned 20 languages over 50 years…
    Avoid these mistakes and you’ll reach conversational fluency sooner.”
    
    MISTAKE #1: “Too difficult”
    No language is impossible—time-to-fluency differs by distance from your native language.
    
    MISTAKE #2: Not listening enough
    Early audio feels like noise. Keep listening anyway.
    Noise → comprehensible speech over time.
    
    MISTAKE #3: Trying to memorize everything
    Don’t brute-force rules. Notice patterns in context.
    
    MISTAKE #4: Speaking too early
    Speak when you want, but prioritize comprehension first.
    
    MISTAKE #5: Staying in beginner content too long
    Move to content you actually enjoy once you know ~500 common words.
    
    MISTAKE #6: Using flashcards too much
    Input matters most: attitude + time + noticing.
    Vocabulary sticks through repeated context.
    
    CONCLUSION
    Avoid the 6 mistakes, but the key is finding time.
    Lead into a follow-up video on time management tips.</pre>
