You see:

There’s a reason why there are 14-year-olds making thousands each day,

While you’re making less than $10k/mo while working long hours at your day jobs.

It’s because these young children have discovered something that most adults will never realize…

The internet gives everyone an equal chance to make money online no matter where you are in life.

For example,

English isn’t my first language,

I dropped out of college in my second year,

And I’m a woman.

But despite this,

I was able to start a side hustle that profits 7 figures each year.

I call it the “Automated Income AI System”,

And it works by creating and selling your own digital products online.

Now, if you’re still watching this Ad,

You’re probably serious about making a lot of girl money online.

So at this point,

You need to make a decision.

You can either go to college for 4 years just to work at a 9-5 you’re probably going to hate.

OR

Hustle for 2 years to make a 7-figure income working 3 hours per day.

If you chose the second option,

My 5-step roadmap to build an “Automated Income AI System” will help you achieve those goals.

It has all the information I wish I had when first starting this side hustle.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

With this guide, you’ll know how to finally quit your 9-5 and get the attention and money you deserve.

Are you tired of working at your unfulfilling 9-5 job?

Taking on extra projects, working unpaid overtime, not using your vacation days,

But despite all that hard work you’re putting in,

You’re not getting the credit or pay that you deserve.

If you feel like this,

Then I can help you out.

My name’s Hannah,

And I help women make an extra $1k+/day in passive income with just a lunch break's worth of work,

So they can finally start living their best girly lives.

With the AI business model that I teach,

I’ve generated over seven figures in profit over the last two years.

With that extra money and freedom,

I’ve been able to move to Dubai, travel to over 20 countries, and see my friends almost every day.

And now, I want to help you do the same.

That’s why I’m giving you a 5-step income system roadmap.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

‘I’m so happy another man bought me this car.

I could never buy a car like this because I’ve never worked a day in my life.’

Many people believe this is what I’m thinking each day,

But it’s not true.

I bought all my cars, houses, and luxury trips with my hard-earned money.

How?

Well, I used to work at a 9-5 while only making $6k/mo,

But started a unique side hustle a little under 2 years ago,

And I’ve scaled it to make me over $100k/mo.

And no,

I didn’t start a clothing brand or become an affiliate marketer,

And I never had to take off a single piece of clothing.

This side hustle is called AI income automation,

And you create and sell your own digital products.

This means you’ll never have to worry about stocking inventory or having good profit margins.

And with the help of AI,

90% of the process is automated,

So you can make all this money while barely working 2 hours per day.

So how can you get started?

Well, it took me 6 months to start making $30k/mo,

But I’ve seen people scale to that income in just 3 months.

To help you make $1k/mo+ in passive income in as little time as possible,

I created a 5-step income system roadmap.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

With this guide, you’ll know how to finally quit your 9-5 and get the attention and money you deserve.

          <pre class="copy">Attention fitness coaches…

If you’re struggling to find qualified leads,

Then this funnel might be one of the best solutions going into 2025.

It’s called the “AR” funnel.

And it has helped over 500 fitness coaches make an additional $20k/mo from the extra customers.

The funnel works by attracting ready-to-buy leads for your business,

And ultimately get a recurring subscription so large that you may not need to run Ads to make money.

Best of all, it’s a fully automatic done-for-you funnel that can be installed for just a one-time payment.

If you’d like our help to install the “AR” funnel into your fitness business to help you attract more qualified leads,

Click the ‘Learn More’ button below to see if we’re a good fit for each other.

This is the perfect opportunity going into the New Year.

More people are setting fitness goals,

Deciding to finally get in shape,

And looking into buying fitness programs.

So this is the best time to optimize your lead-generation system.

No other time in the year has more people looking to invest in fitness coaches than now.

So don’t miss out on the value this funnel can provide.

          <pre class="copy">If you’re a fitness coach looking to make more money,

Then this video is for you.

There’s a system fitness coaches are using to make 10-20% more revenue each month.

And they don’t need to search for new leads,

Increase their prices,

Or buy premade lead lists.

In fact, once this system is installed in a fitness business,

The owner can generate income without even lifting a finger.

And that is…

A referral system.

Yes, this is what thousands of personal trainers are currently sleeping on.

Think about it…

You trust your friends and family,

So if they recommend a personal trainer,

You’ll take their word for it because you know they have good intentions for you.

These referrals are more often qualified leads ready to invest in themselves.

A referral system can create additional revenue while having low maintenance.

And that’s why I made it the main priority to include in my “AR” funnel.

It’s a fully DFY sales funnel to not only attract more qualified leads,

But it also includes a referral system to potentially increase your MRR by 10-20%.

You can get all this for a one-time payment.

So if you’re ready to see if the “AR” funnel is a right fit based on your specific business,

We’ll analyze your business’s current situation,

Give you advice to scale based on where you’re at,

This usually happens for 3 main reasons:

The brands are running ads that barely break even,

The business is struggling to find leads who actually want to invest in their services,

And they rely on cold outreach and inconsistent ad campaigns to survive.

But what if you didn’t have to?

What if you could consistently attract high-paying clients without spending a dime on ads?

That’s where the “AR” funnel comes in.

          <pre class="copy">Hook: Hair loss and heart attacks have one scary thing in common: the longer you wait, the worse it gets.

Doctors often talk about how with heart attacks, the sooner you get help, the better your chances of survival.

And the thing is…

Your scalp works the same way.

Hair loss isn't just some "cosmetic thing".

It's a sign that your follicles are starving,

That blood circulation's down,

And that the environment on your scalp isn't ideal for your hair to grow.

And if you wait?

Those follicles can go dormant and begin to die,

Making it much harder for your hair to get back to looking its best.

I'm not trying to scare you.

I just wish someone had told me this earlier.

Because I waited.

I kept covering my hair with hats.

And even though I'd see less and less hair whenever I took my hat off,

I kept telling myself I was "overthinking it".

I made the mistake of waiting too long to fix my hair loss problem,

And now, it'll take me around 6 months longer to get my ideal results.

So don't wait until your hairline has already started receding.

The sooner you start treating this problem, the quicker your hair will grow.

The best solution I found was ______.

It's designed to block DHT and create an ideal environment for hair to grow in.

It's 100% natural. No hormones. No sketchy side effects.

Just ingredients like:

______ to increase blood flow to your follicles.

______ to cleanse the scalp of impurities.

And ______ to inhibit the DHT in your body.

Plus, if you're not seeing results? There's a 90-day money-back guarantee.

Click the "Shop now" button below to start treating your hair loss over the long term.

If you're having mild hair loss,

Then the 3-pack would work well for you.

But if you've started losing a lot of hair,

The 6-pack of shampoo would likely be your best option.

Not only would you prevent yourself from running out before seeing results,

But you'd also get a massive discount buying the shampoo in a bundle.</pre>

          <pre class="copy">Hook: Would you wait for a heart attack to start caring about your heart? Then don't wait to go bald to start caring about your scalp.

Look, I get it…

When hair starts thinning, it's easy to just ignore it, tell yourself it's stress, or maybe no one else notices.

But deep down, you know that sinking feeling every time you look in the mirror.

Or wear hats indoors and hope no one asks why.

But here's the thing:

In the same way that you have a higher chance of surviving a heart attack if it's treated early,

You're more likely to treat hair loss when you act early.

That's why ______ can be the perfect shampoo to help your scalp start growing hair again.

______ helps every man with hair loss.

It doesn't matter if you see the first signs or if you only have a couple of strands left.

The difference is the time it takes to get it back.

Simply use ______ 5 times per week for long-lasting results without the side effects or high costs of traditional treatments.

Hair takes time to heal and grow,

And treating your scalp consistently is what will help you see results in the long term.

Plus, you'll save money. avoid running out halfway through, and can take advantage of the 90-day, no-questions-asked guarantee.

Look, it's simple:

The longer you wait, the worse your hair loss will get.

If you're having mild hair loss,

Then the 3-pack would work well for you.

But if you've started losing a lot of hair,

The 6-pack of shampoo would likely be your best option.

So don't overthink it.

Hair loss works the same way.

Sounds dramatic, I know.

But it's true.

When someone has a heart attack, timing is everything.

Every minute that goes by, more damage is done to the tissue.

And it's the same with your hair.

When you start noticing the extra hairs on your pillow when you wake up in the morning, 

Your scalp is sending out a signal that it needs to be treated as soon as possible.

And if you act fast?

You've got a good shot at waking them back up.

But if you wait, those follicles will start shutting down.

You can still grow healthy hair,

But the only difference is that it will potentially take months longer to see results.

That's why ______  hit me so hard.

Because it's built for early intervention.

The shampoo works by blocking DHT, strengthening the hair follicles, and stimulating blood flow to the scalp.

And the best part?

It's 100% natural, doesn't cause any side effects, and creates an ideal environment for hair to grow in.

I noticed only a few hairs falling out after a couple of months.

That's why I always say if you're gonna try ______,

I'd recommend you get the 6-bottle bundle.

That's the amount your hair needs to start seeing results after consistent use.

And hey, if you don't like it?

There's a 90-day 100% money-back guarantee, no questions asked.

This means that your hair has almost nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Sounds crazy, but it's true.

With cardiac arrest, every second matters.

Wait too long, and the damage to your heart tissue will be harder to fix.

Hair loss works on a similar principle.

You see, your scalp has thousands of little hair follicles.

They don't all just fall out one day: they weaken and are eventually unable to start producing hair again.

But here's the thing:

If you act early, you can revive them.

If you don't? 

They die off… and it may take much longer to start growing healthy, thick hair.

And so if you start early,

The best solution I've found to combat hair loss is ______.

Because it's designed to treat the problem at the root, literally.
It goes deep, clearing the blockages and feeding your hair the important nutrients it needs to grow again.

______ contains ______  to bring blood back to the scalp, Plant-based DHT blockers to detox the follicles, and herbal extracts like ______ and ______ to stimulate fresh hair growth.

And because it works best if you're consistent over a few weeks or months,

If your hair looks something like this [insert image],

I'd recommend getting the pack of 3.

If your hair looks more like this [insert image],

I'd recommend getting the pack of 6.

That's how you can save money while avoiding potentially running out in the middle.

Remember: whether it's your heart or your hair, it doesn't matter.

          </div>
          <pre class="copy">When my doctor prescribed me Finasteride, he said to just take the pill once per day and to find a way to deal with the potential side effects. What he didn't mention were the potential side effects that might never go away, even after stopping the medication.
I discovered this the hard way. Six months into treatment, I noticed changes such as decreased libido, difficulty concentrating, and a persistent brain fog that affected my work performance. My hair marginally improved while all other aspects of my life deteriorated. 
But when the depression became too much to handle, I finally decided to stop taking the pills, expecting my body to return to normal within weeks, but it didn't.
I did some research on the internet and learned about Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS) -  a condition where Finasteride's side effects last long after stopping using the drug. Forums were filled with men sharing similar experiences, some suffering for years after their last dose.
I was terrified. Had I permanently damaged my health for the sake of my hairline? Thankfully, I hadn't and the symptoms went away after a few more weeks, but I knew I needed to find an alternative solution.
After doing a lot of research, I discovered _____. It works by gently removing buildup that suffocates follicles while blocking DHT with natural ingredients like _____. And the best part is that this shampoo doesn't cause any side effects.
The difference was remarkable. Within weeks of switching, my scalp was cleaner, and I was seeing less hair on my comb. Within 3 months, my hair was actually thicker than when I was on the prescription. And after 6 months, my doctor complimented how full and healthy my hair was looking.
Right now, you can get the 6-month supply of _____ at a 66% discount. This ensures you won't run out in the middle of your hair regrowth journey. And it's completely risk-free with _____'s 90-day money-back guarantee.

          <pre class="copy">It's 10 PM on a Tuesday. I'm standing in my bathroom, exhausted after a long day, checking my hair loss calendar to confirm what torture awaits me tonight. It looks like today's Minoxidil day. The itching it causes is extremely irritating. It feels like mosquito bites you can't scratch. 
Tomorrow won't be much better, though. The stinging, the redness, and the occasional bleeding were all tough to deal with, but I thought that was just the cost of regrowing my hair.
But the worst part is that after 3 months of this, all I had to show for it was a collection of half-used products, a permanently irritated scalp, and hair that was marginally – if at all – improved.
I was about to give up entirely when my cousin visited for the weekend. The same cousin who, last year, had been noticeably balder than I. Now, he had a full, thick head of hair that looked completely natural.
He didn't have any painful procedures or expensive treatments. He said he just used _____.
I was skeptical but desperate, so I tried it. The difference was immediate. Instead of pain, I felt a refreshing tingling sensation. The natural ingredients like _____, _____, and _____ cleaned my scalp and created an ideal environment for hair to grow in. At the same time, _____ blocked DHT, so my hair follicles could start producing healthy hair again.
After 3 months, I started seeing more growth on my temples. And after 6 months, people were actually commenting on how much thicker my hair looked.
For the best results, I recommend getting the 6-month supply of _____, which comes with an amazing 66% discount. This ensures you won't run out in the middle of your regrowth journey.

          <pre class="copy">Hook: I used to think my thinning hair was due to bad genetics.
When I first went to see my dermatologist, he offered the usual solutions like daily pills that would irritate my scalp and affect my performance in the bedroom. But at the time, I thought those were the only options. I either had to deal with losing hair or the other side effects.
But one day, I was watching a documentary when I found out something I wish I knew sooner: the real culprit behind most hair loss isn't just your family tree – it's DHT, a hormone that attaches to your hair follicles and gradually chokes them until they can't produce healthy hair anymore. If you find a way to block DHT and get your follicles the bloodflow and nutrients they need, you'll likely start growing hair again.
I looked into the pills I was taking and found that they were just covering up the problem instead of solving the root cause. So I did some research to see if I could find a more effective solution, and  I discovered the _____. Instead of adding another step to my routine, it replaced something I was already doing – washing my hair.
The plant-based formula contains _____ that blocks DHT and _____ to give your follicles the nutrients they need. This created the optimal environment for new hair growth without the side effects of prescription medications.
Within 8 weeks, I noticed significantly less shedding. By week 12, I could see actual regrowth in areas that had been thinning for years. And after 6 months, my wife actually complimented how good my hair looked.
Right now, you can get a 6-month supply of _____ at 66% off the regular price – fully protected by a 90-day money-back guarantee.

Dialogue: "This was my life… every single day. Who was the culprit?"

Scene 2
Visual: Quick shot of cat looking guilty near the litter box. Shocked music in the background
Text Overlay: "The culprit."

Scene 3
Visual: Actor selfie-style, holding Catalyst bag. Cat walking in the background.
Dialogue: "I must confess: my apartment always used to smell like straight-up cat poop, but it doesn't anymore."

Scene 4
Visual: Actor pours Catalyst into a litter box. Close-up of clean wood texture.
Dialogue: "That's because I switched to Catalyst litter, and here are three reasons why I'll never go back."

Scene 5
Visual: "Before" shot: actor spraying air freshener, waving hand at nose. "After" shot: cat walking across the floor, actor sniffing the air in relief.
Dialogue: "First, this cat litter has way better odor control. My previous cat litter always left that sour, wet-cement smell that never really went away, no matter how much I scooped.
With Catalyst, I couldn't smell a thing. When guests would come over, they actually didn't know I even had a cat until seeing her walk by."

Scene 6
Visual: "Before" shot: Actor pouring clay litter → big dust cloud. Coughing exaggeratedly.
"After" shot: Actor scooping Catalyst clump → comes out without dust going everywhere.
Dialogue: "Second, my lungs and my cat's lungs are far happier now. Clay turns into gross, dusty cement at the bottom. I'd cough, she'd sneeze, and scraping cement off the bottom of the pan was always such a nightmare."
But with Catalyst, there aren't any dust clouds. Pouring it is so much easier."

Scene 7
Visual: Box delivered to the doorstep. The actor pretends to flex her muscles while lifting the Catalyst bag with one hand. Then the scene shows her wobbling comically while lifting a heavy clay box with both hands. 
Text overlay: "No gym required."
Dialogue: "Third, it's lighter to carry. Catalyst is made from upcycled wood instead of strip-mined clay. It actually breaks down instead of sitting in a landfill for a thousand years. So it's lighter and eco-friendly, unlike my old clay litter. That's a win-win."

Scene 8
Visual: Actor sitting relaxed on the couch with her cat.
Dialogue: "And all of these benefits come at an amazing price. Catalyst lasts way longer and is almost half the price of the clay junk I was paying for before."

"Bro, some dudes can't grow a full beard. It's just genetics, right?"
For years, I used to believe that.
[RELATABLE MOMENT]
I'd look in the mirror every morning, check if the sides were any more connected, and just shake my head.
No matter what I did, my beard never looked right to me. And honestly, it started to mess with my confidence. 
I didn't want to accept that mine could be patchy forever. But then I'd see comments online saying that "no product applied topically could alter my genetics," so I figured, what's the point?
[BUILD THE PAIN]
My beard was dry, itchy, uneven, and looked like it had given up on itself halfway through growing. I hated it.
I tried a bunch of products, but they either made my skin burn, smelled weird, or did absolutely nothing. Eventually, I got so frustrated that I was contemplating just shaving it all off.
[INTRODUCE THE SOLUTION]
But one day, I was talking to an old friend, and he told me about Respected Roots. It's a 3-step kit for your beard. The Foaming Co-Wash cleans your face without drying out your beard The Beard Oil hydrates and strengthens it, and the Beard Conditioner softens it and makes it look more even. It's a formula that keeps your beard healthy and helps it look fuller over time.
[EXPERIENCE]

It doesn't overpower my nose, but lingers just enough to be noticeable. Turns out my beard growth problems weren't due to genetics. I was just using the wrong product.

My girlfriend hates it when I do this beard routine to fix my patchy spots.
[SET THE SCENE]
Last week, we went out for dinner to a new spot. We sat down, and before we even got our drinks, the hostess started flirting with me, right in front of my girlfriend.
[CONTINUE THE STORY / BUILD HUMOR]
After dinner ended, while we were walking back to the car, this woman crossing the street stopped me, told me my beard looked super soft, and asked if she could touch it. My girlfriend looked like she wanted to slap that lady.


Later that night, we swung by a friend's house. And as soon as we walk in, he goes, "Bro, your beard's looking real good. What have you been using on it?" He didn't even acknowledge my girlfriend. She was just scrolling on her phone while my friend was asking me about my beard for most of the night. Later, she told me that she didn't ever want me using that routine again."
[SHARE THE JOURNEY / WHAT I TRIED BEFORE]
Now, you gotta understand that this is new for me. My beard used to be dry, patchy, and uneven. I tried all those random oils and YouTube hacks, but they either made my skin flare up or just didn't do anything.
[SHARE THE SOLUTION / "AHA" MOMENT]
But then, I discovered this 3-step beard care routine from Respected Roots. The Foaming Co-Wash cleans your face without drying out your beard. The Beard Oil helps strengthen it, and the Beard Conditioner reduces the appearance of patchiness.

            <p><strong>Mass Desire:</strong> To wake up feeling normal again after drinking, without guilt, bloating, or sluggishness, while also protecting long-term health.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Avatar:</strong> 32-year-old male, social drinker, busy professional. He wants rapid recovery after nights out, simple solutions, and peace of mind about his liver health.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Testing Rationale:</strong> This script uses a historical story to build curiosity, position Milk Thistle as an ancient secret, and make the supplement feel like a modern version of an effective solution the Romans used. This could perform well because it doesn't sound like a generic pill pitch.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #1:</strong> Ancient Romans would drink wine all night, eat like a king, then wake up ready to fight battles the next morning, and it was all because of a weird purple flower…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #2:</strong> After drinking copious amounts of alcohol, ancient Roman soldiers recovered as if nothing had happened with this strange purple flower you've probably never heard of…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #3:</strong> Historians used to be puzzled by how Roman soldiers were able to fight without collapsing after nights of heavy drinking and feasting. That was until they found out about this weird purple flower…</p>
          </div>

          <pre class="copy">In 69 AD, also known as the Year of the Four Emperors, Italy was devastated by its civil war. Battles stretched across the empire, from the hills of Rome to the distant rural areas.

Roman soldiers were fighting all day with brutal intensity. Thousands were marching on little to no sleep.

But here's the part that used to confuse historians. At the end of those grueling days, those soldiers had large feasts and drank goblets of strong wine, often until late into the night. The celebrations were as fierce as the battles themselves.

Yet, by dawn, they were back in formation, marching and fighting like normal. How was that possible? Well, the Romans had a secret weapon that came from a plant.

Roman healers noticed something strange. A group of soldiers who consumed a certain spiky purple flower seemed to recover quicker than those who didn't. While others groaned with pain, feeling heavy with bloating and nausea from the wine and food, the men who consumed this plant had more energy, felt lighter, and were ready for battle sooner.

The healers began experimenting. They crushed the seeds, brewed them in teas, and even ground them into powders to mix with food and drink. And time after time, the soldiers who ate the flower felt lighter, stronger, and more alert.

Over months, the plant developed a reputation. Commanders quietly encouraged their troops to consume it after nights of heavy drinking.

That plant was Milk Thistle, and it wasn't just soldiers who used it. After the war ended, Roman citizens brought it into their homes. Physicians documented it in their medical texts. And later, medieval healers called it the "protector of the liver." And to be clear, this wasn't some kind of fad. It was evidence-based proof that was recorded, respected, and trusted across centuries.

So why don't most people know about this? Why isn't it in every doctor's office and pharmacy?

Because here's the uncomfortable truth. You can't patent a plant. And if you can't patent it, you can't make billions selling it as a prescription drug.

So while the studies piled up in journals and scientists were confirming Milk Thistle's ability to detoxify the liver, the wider medical world turned a blind eye.

There wasn't much money to be made in trying to sell a solution that nature already solved.

Instead, attention shifted to creating solutions that could be patented and sold at a premium. Solutions that mask symptoms were promoted more than ones that targeted the root cause.

I mean, think about how most people handle liver stress today. They drink coffee after a night out to cover fatigue. They grab antacids when their stomach feels bloated the night after drinking. They pop painkillers for their stomach pain.

But none of those addresses the real issue:  Having a liver that's clogged and overworked from modern living.

During all this time, Milk Thistle stayed in the shadows.

But not everyone forgot about it. Over the years, researchers kept circling back to it. They ran trials on patients with liver stress. They documented improvements. And they measured enzyme levels dropping back toward normal ranges.

And slowly, the picture became clearer. This was science that had been ignored because it wasn't profitable.

Modern science has finally caught up with what those ancient healers already knew. Scientists recently discovered that Milk Thistle contains a compound called Silymarin. This compound helps the liver flush out toxins more effectively and supports the regeneration of liver cells.

That's why soldiers could recover so quickly. Their livers were being restored while they rested. And that's why people who use it today notice clearer energy, lighter digestion, and fewer of those heavy, toxic mornings.

But there's something that the ancients didn't know. The Silymarin didn't work in isolation. It got help from other key ingredients.

Roman soldiers ate lots of oranges shipped across the empire. These oranges were a huge source of their Vitamin C. Today, modern science confirms it enhances overall vitality and immune defense, giving the body resilience.

Ancient diets also often included plant extracts that soothed digestion and kept the gut in balance. Scientists now know that pairing Milk Thistle with digestive-friendly compounds helps reduce bloating and discomfort even more effectively.

So what happens when you bring those allies together, in the right combination, in the right amounts?

You get a formula that actually improves on what the Romans had.

That's what SerraNaturals Milk Thistle Support does. It's a clean, natural formula built around the same Milk Thistle ingredient Romans relied on to recover. It's also paired with Vitamin C, plant-based extracts, and other complementary nutrients that modern research has shown to support energy, digestion, and resilience.

So instead of waking up groggy and sluggish after a night out, you could wake up with clear energy. Instead of random bloating after heavy meals, your digestion could feel light and comfortable. And instead of worrying quietly about the long-term damage of alcohol or toxins, you could feel confident you're supporting your body where it matters most.

And it doesn't require a radical lifestyle change either. You don't have to quit drinking or starve yourself with cleanses. You just have to take 1 pill each day. That's it. And because all the ingredients are natural, you don't have to worry about any crazy side effects.

To make this discovery accessible to as many people as possible, SerraNaturals is offering 11% off on their 90-day supply right now. But because of the high demand, they don't know how much longer they'll be able to offer it at that price.

So if you'd like to give your body the same advantage Roman soldiers carried into battle, and feel what it's like to live lighter, clearer, and stronger every single day. This is your chance to finally do that.

            <p><strong>Avatar Targeted:</strong> Women 40+, menopausal or post-menopausal, tired of bloating, weight gain, and feeling like their body betrayed them. Especially those scared of prescriptions like Ozempic.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Testing Rationale:</strong> This ad throws stones at the other weight loss options for menopausal women (Ozempic, fat burners, keto) and contrasts Lipozem as the safe, easy, sustainable option that doesn't cause side effects. This ad is for a solution-aware audience.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #1:</strong> I finally lost my menopausal belly, and I didn't do it the way you'd expect…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #2:</strong> There's a way to lose post-menopausal weight you probably don't know about…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #3:</strong> Here's how I finally lost weight after 40 without Ozempic, keto, or endless workouts…</p>
          </div>

          <pre class="copy">I heard about and tried dozens of marketed solutions, but none of them appealed to me.

Ozempic seemed to work for many women, but the side effects, like nausea, bloating, and stomach problems, deterred me from trying it. Also, many women reported that those side effects didn't actually ever go away, even after they stopped taking the medication. I tried fat burners before, too, but the jitters and crashes made me feel worse than before I tried them. I also tried Keto, but I always ended up regaining the weight I worked so hard to lose. It just wasn't a sustainable solution over the long term.

I was frustrated by not being able to find a solution without any side effects. I didn't want to have to choose between losing weight and dealing with other health issues.

I was almost ready to give up, but after a lot of research, I eventually discovered Lipozem.

It uses all-natural clinical-grade salts like Magnesium, Calcium, and Sodium that help your body break down fat, turn it into energy, and eliminate fatigue, along with those nonstop cravings.

And the best part: it doesn't contain any caffeine, require any needles, or come with any nasty side effects because all the ingredients are natural. You just have to take two capsules per day.

The women in the reviews were calling it life-changing. They were saying things like "My cravings are gone." "I finally fit into my old jeans again." "I feel energized and in control."

And that's exactly how I feel now.

The only problem? Every time word gets out about their 70% discount on the 5-pack, bottles sell out fast. And when they're gone, it can take weeks before they're back in stock.

So if you want a safe way to flatten your belly, feel energized, and finally get control of your body again without risking permanent side effects, click the 'learn more' below to try Lipozem today at the cheapest price it'll ever be at.</pre>

        <pre class="copy">Subject Line: Here’s why you should date 4 women
Preview Text: Not what you think…

%FIRSTNAME%,

If you’re not a modern sheik in today’s world,

And you’re not dating at least 4 women at once…

Then what are you doing?

Now, I might sound like a misogynist when I say that,

But hear me out.

<img src="images/promo-email1.png" alt="Promo Email Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

These 4 girlfriends that you have shouldn't exist in real life,
But rather your imagination.

What do I mean by this?
Acting like you're dating four girls will solve many of your needy problems.

Think about it:
If you were dating 4 women,
Would you care if one of them didn’t text you back or cancelled plans at the last minute?
Would it be a big deal if one of the relationships didn’t work out?

Chances are you wouldn’t be too upset because you’d have other options.

When you don’t put all your faith into one person,
You’ll seem less needy and more confident,
Which will make you more attractive to the woman you’re dating.

So %FIRSTNAME%,
Next time you feel a certain way about a girl,
Then just ask yourself…
‘Would I feel this way if I had 4 girlfriends?’

If the answer is no,
Then it means you’re being needy and need to change your behavior.

Now, you may be wondering:
‘This all sounds good,
But what can I do not to act desperate?’

Well, if that’s the case,
I’ve taught hundreds of men the blueprint not to be needy.

Preview Text: Here’s how…

It’s true %FIRSTNAME%,
The ugly baby concept is preventing IG growth.

And it’s not for the reason you think.

I know, the name might sound weird,
But hear me out.

The idea refers to when a creator thinks their work is high-quality,
But a viewer thinks it’s terrible.

It’s the same reason why a toddler thinks he drew the next Mona Lisa
even though he just scribbled all over the paper.

As creators,
We know how much effort we put into the content,
So we’re biased to thinking the reels are better than they actually are.

This is why we may spend 5 hours creating a reel,
Only for it to get 11 likes.

Now %FIRSTNAME%,
I’ve found that the best way to prevent this from happening…
To have an expert to critique your content.

Not only can they provide unbiased feedback,
But they can also give advice on how to improve in the future.

So despite the funny name,
The ugly baby concept could be the reason your social media isn’t growing as fast as you’d like.

And if you’d like access to an expert who can give you constant feedback,

Preview Text: Not what you think…

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

It was December 25, 2006.
I checked my mailbox and saw that I’d gotten a Christmas card from my dentist.

The message read “Happy Holidays, brush twice a day, floss regularly!”

Why am I telling you this?

Many of your conversations with women are like my dentist's Christmas card:
Boring, generic, and templated.

Do you think you’ll create an unforgettable impression by saying…
“I like your outfit.”
“What do you do for work?”
“The weather’s nice today.”

The truth is…
She’ll see you as just another random guy with no personality.

That’s why when you speak to a woman,
You should focus more on making her emotional.

Crack a witty joke,
Playfully tease her,
You could even tell her she’s fatter than the sun.
(Although I don’t recommend that 😂)

So next time you speak to a woman,
Don't be like my dentist's Christmas card.

Invoke strong emotions,
And she’ll get hooked to you.

Now with all that being said,
I have to make an important disclaimer…

Although the exact phrases you say to her are important,
They alone won’t make her feel emotional.

You need to have open body language,
Master small talk to avoid having dry conversations,
And know how to have good conversations over text.

That’s why in my 3-month coaching program,
You’ll not only learn how to speak to women to become a walking chick magnet,
But you’ll also get access to
My fiercely guarded PREMIUM seduction secrets to become irresistibly attractive to women.
Exclusive coaching calls to learn texting basics, bedroom mastery, and everything in between.
Access to my Brotherhood Facebook group to get so many dates you can’t fit them all on your calendar.

As a bonus,
If you haven’t been on any dates after the 3 months,
You can stay in the program for FREE until you do.

There’s going to be a huge discount.

But despite being irritating,
The messages teach an important lesson on how NOT to build a brand on IG.

Think about it…
Did you enjoy seeing those spammy unpersonalized messages?

You probably just ignored them, and for good reason.

The thing is %FIRSTNAME%…
People hate being sold to.

Ads are so common nowadays.
You’re probably tired of seeing them in every corner of the internet.

That’s why people more than ever before crave genuine and approachable brands,
As opposed to ones that are constantly hard-selling.

To make sure your brand falls into the first category,
You need to do the following:
Be authentic and share your personality so your target audience can easily connect with you.
Make the content engaging so people look forward to your posts.
Give actionable value so your audience sees you as the go-to authority in your niche.

By implementing these tips,
Your content will engage your target audience better.

Preview Text: 8 years of dating experience inside

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Do you tend to stay home and keep to a small circle of friends?
If so, you’re just like me when I was 20.

I would play video games all day without talking to anyone.
I was so shy that my hands used to shake uncontrollably whenever I’d talk to women.

Every time I’d talk to one at the grocery store,
I’d have a nervous breakdown and stutter and look like an idiot.

It got to the point where even going out in public was hard sometimes.
I didn’t know if I’d ever be able to get rid of my social anxiety.

But after a few months, just by implementing 3 new habits,
I found that I was not only able to overcome my social anxiety,
But also turn on my ‘extrovert switch’ whenever necessary.

Here are 3 things I did to overcome my social anxiety about talking to women.

1. Say ‘yes’ whenever you’re invited somewhere.
Even if the activity bored me to tears,
I’d show up to get more chances to leave the house and talk to people.

Women can sense if you haven’t talked to anyone in months,
So give yourself as many opportunities to socialize as possible.

2. Leave your house for at least 20-30 minutes every day.
It doesn’t matter where you go as long as you talk to everyone you see.

I started doing this when I was 20,
And I’m still consistent with it at 28 years old.

I just make simple comments like…
“Hey, how’s your day going?”
“I like your glasses.”
“You have a cool outfit.”

Regularly talking to everybody will make you more comfortable around women.

3. Go to a nightlife venue at least once per week.
Stay sober the entire time and talk to as many people as possible.

It might feel uncomfortable being around drunk people,
But if you drop any judgment, you’ll enjoy yourself more.

Use what I call the ‘anti-drunk method’.
Drunk people don’t care what others think,
So you need to do the same.

Once you start letting loose while speaking,
You’ll come off as more likable.

Those are 3 life-changing habits you can apply to your daily life.

Even though I don’t have difficulties talking to women anymore,
I still follow these habits because they help me feel more confident,
And I’m sure they’ll help you too.

Rooting for you.

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

If you offer coaching, consulting, or run a DFY agency,
Then you’re probably familiar with the following…

Cold calling for 3 hours without reaching a single interested prospect.
Sending 2000 emails without finding any warm leads.
Paying thousands for a course only for it to be filled with generic templates.

These experiences aren't enjoyable for most people.
You usually need to spend days outreaching before seeing results.

And we all know what that feels like…

<img src="images/urgency-email1.png" alt="Urgency Email Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

But I spoke to my friend Adam recently,
And he came up with a new way to get qualified leads for his agency.

He calls his new method the “2-step Webinar Cracker”,
And he got 35% of his contacts to join his agency as a result of it.

He’s also taught hundreds of other people how to use this framework,
And many of them have hit their first 30k, 50k, and even 100k+ month because of it.

Unlike other ‘gurus’ who may charge 15k for their frameworks,
Adam and I will be showing you how this method works in a F.R.E.E. 2-day live event.

The event will take place December 10-11 from 7-10 pm EST on both days.


Stay scaling,

P.S. Don’t worry, we won’t be selling you any courses during the event.

That’s like asking them to marry you without even getting on a call with them.

Some months ago,

My friends and I decided to throw on our helmets,

Zip up our biker jackets,

And ride our motorcycles on the highway together.

But believe it or not,

This experience taught me an important lesson about growing an online business.

Right as we were about to get going,

I couldn't get my bike to move.

I checked everything: the engine, fuel, throttle,

All those things were on point.

I couldn't figure out why the motorcycle wasn't going anywhere.

I was about to wave my friends off when they all burst out laughing. 

One of them pointed and said, 

"Your shaft is in neutral dude, not in drive."

My face turned red as a tomato when I realized this,

But once I got moving with the wind in my face,

I realized something…

The gear shaft on my motorcycle is a lot like limiting beliefs in business.

It doesn't matter how powerful your bike is or how hard you rev the engine.

When set to neutral,

You're not going anywhere.

And the same principle applies to business.

You can have the best strategies and tools at your disposal, 

But if you constantly have thoughts like:

"I don't have enough time."

"Why would MY business be successful?"

"I'm too tired today."

Your business growth stagnates.

You may have the power and potential, 

But without changing gears, 

You'll go nowhere.

To fix this problem %FIRSTNAME%,

Start by recognizing which limiting beliefs are holding you back. 

Then, actively replace them with beliefs that align with your goals. 

Once you do this,

Your business will grow surprisingly quickly,

Especially if many other elements are working.

You got this,

SERIOUSLY? 

How could anyone possibly afford that?

I was FUMING inside.

The year was 2016 and I was working overtime as a nurse WHILE PREGNANT, just to qualify for maternity leave.

Then, as soon as my son was born,

BAM!

A $3,000 daycare bill slapped me across my face.

It was unbelievable,

I couldn't afford that enormous cost,

Despite thinking I did everything right:

I got good grades,

Graduated from university,

And got a 'high-paying' job helping other people.

But I was barely scraping by while being overworked.

I promised myself that one day,

I'd be able to provide for my family without missing a moment with my kids.

I went down the internet rabbit hole endlessly searching for a solution,

Until I eventually came across digital marketing.

It wasn't easy,

And it took a lot of time, energy, and effort from me,

But it was all worth it.

Just one year after starting,

I made my first 7-figures online,

More money than I'd made in 10 years as a nurse.

Since then, I've bought my dream house,

And I'm able to work my desired hours from the comfort of my own home,

While spending ample time with my children.

Digital marketing changed my life %FIRSTNAME%,

And the side hustle could change yours too.

Preview Text: Here's how it works…

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Here's a photo from our trip to Taiwan last summer.

<img src="images/story-email3.png" alt="Story Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

We spent 9 days in the beautiful country,

And had the time of our lives,

But were also taught an important lesson about making money online.

When we were planning the itinerary,

We were stuck between two amazing spots:

A national park with incredible views and a beach with insane waves.

But given the time constraint,

We couldn't enjoy both of them to the fullest extent.

We either had to spend the entire day in one place,

Or spend half the day in each.

We initially considered the latter,

But our inner entrepreneur caused us to change our minds at the last minute.

We decided to spend the whole day at the beach,

Which turned out to be the best decision we could've made.

Not only would the commute between them have wasted 3 hours,

But we surfed some of the biggest waves of our lives.

By choosing to stick with one option,

We accomplished more as opposed to juggling both,

And the same principle applies to picking a business.

Many people spread themselves too thin by hopping between business models,

Sacrificing everything and pushing themselves to their limits,

But not dedicating themselves enough to a single craft to see results.

The people who started making thousands per month quickly went deep,  not wide.

They picked one business model and stuck to it,

Eating, sleeping, and breathing it every hour of the day.

It takes time and dedication to see development,

But it's always worth it in the end.

And sure, you can start other ventures later on to diversify your income.

But it's not a good idea to juggle between multiple businesses all at once.

Build one, 

Grow it, 

Sustain it,

Then move into other avenues.

In contrast, with "shiny object syndrome",

You'll be miserable for several months without any achievements to show off in the end.

So pick ONE business model, 

And don't switch until you've found success.

You'll be able to take action sooner and waste less time trying to choose the "best" one.

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Congratulations on finishing the final week of the 3-month coaching program.

In the past 12 weeks, you learned how to…

Confidently approach women and make the best first impression to increase the number of dates you get,
Set up the perfect first date to tap into her psychology and build the most attraction possible,
Master the art of texting and seduce her without saying a single word,
Become a physical bedroom beast and give her the most pleasurable experience of her entire life.

At this point, you know more about women than 90% of men on the planet.

You've consumed a lot of content from me,

But now, I want to hear about you.

So I made this quick feedback form.

Feel free to let me know what you liked about the program and what can be improved.

I plan on releasing more trainings soon,

If you're interested in being a part of the next courses I release,

Click here to answer a few questions and help me help you.

Looking forward to reading your responses.

Your Friend,

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

I saw that you filled out the feedback form,

And I appreciate the honesty.

From your responses,

It seems like you enjoyed the 3-month program.

So to provide even more value,

And reward you for your commitment,

I'd like to show you something you've never seen before.

You see…

If you wanted to be able to confidently approach women and go on dates with them,

The 12-week program taught you everything you needed to know.

But if you want to find a lifelong partner,

You need to get past the talking stage.

Resolving conflicts, channeling your inner masculine energy, and maintaining a healthy connection are key in the later stages of a relationship.

These skills are completely different from cold-approaching women.

But here's the thing…

Most men aren't ready for them.

They're still pissing their pants at the mere thought of talking to a girl.

But since you've been consistently consuming the information I've provided,

It's clear that you have a more advanced knowledge of relationships.

So to help you take your dating life to the next stage,

I've released the new 3-month coaching program 2.0!

Inside, you'll not only get access to everything you'd get with the original program,

But you'll also unlock several more modules, including:

12 more weeks of training to smoothly transition to the serious stages and thrive with your longer-term girlfriends, 
Twice as many coaching calls to guide you through this new complex relationship stage,
Access to an exclusive 2.0 community with higher-level conversations and golden nuggets I don't drop anywhere else.

And that's not even scratching the surface.

Click here to learn more about the 3-month coaching program 2.0.

Hope to see you inside %FIRSTNAME%.

Your Friend,

        <pre class="copy">Subject Line: Here's why you should date 4 women
Preview Text: Not what you think…

%FIRSTNAME%,

If you're not a modern sheik in today's world,

And you're not dating at least 4 women at once…

Then what are you doing?

Now, I might sound like a misogynist when I say that,

But hear me out.

<img src="images/upsell-email3.png" alt="Upsell Email Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

These 4 girlfriends that you have shouldn't exist in real life,

But rather your imagination.

What do I mean by this?

Acting like you're dating four girls will solve many of your needy problems.

Think about it:

If you were dating 4 women,

Would you care if one of them didn't text you back or cancelled plans at the last minute?

Would it be a big deal if one of the relationships didn't work out?

Chances are you wouldn't be too upset because you'd have other options.

When you don't put all your faith into one person,

You'll seem less needy and more confident,

Which will make you more attractive to the woman you're dating.

So %FIRSTNAME%,

Next time you feel a certain way about a girl,

Then just ask yourself…

'Would I feel this way if I had 4 girlfriends?'

If the answer is no,

Then it means you're being needy and need to change your behavior.

Now, you may be wondering:

'This all sounds good,

But what can I do not to act desperate?'

Well, if that's the case,

I've taught hundreds of men the blueprint not to be needy.

In 12 weeks, they've gone from struggling to set boundaries with their partner,

To thrive in their romantic relationships.

If you'd like access to this framework,

Reply to this email with the word "FOUR",

And I'll send it over to you.

Your friend,

    It may be because of this 1 big mistake I see many men make.
    
    [In this part, &lt;name&gt; wears a backward cap and acts like a guy swiping on an app.]
    
    “She’s an accountant?
    Nah, she’s probably boring.
    
    She’s wearing a cross in a photo?
    I’ll pass, I don’t want to date someone who’s extremely religious.
    
    She has a photo of herself on a farm?
    No thank you, I prefer to live in the city, so the relationship probably won’t work out.”
    
    [Back to being &lt;name&gt;.]
    
    Stop.
    
    Dating apps only show a tiny part of someone’s personality.
    
    You can’t know everything about a person just by looking at a couple of photos.
    
    Here’s the truth:
    
    That accountant you thought would be boring could be one of the funniest, most adventurous people you ever met.
    
    That girl wearing the cross might not be religious.
    She may just be wearing it because her family does.
    
    And that woman on the farm could’ve just been visiting the place.
    She may like the city just as much as you do.
    
    The point is…
    
    You should avoid swiping solely based on surface-level judgments.
    
    Remove the filters,
    Have an open mind when you swipe on the apps.
    
    And you’ll be amazed at the people you might meet.
    
    But wait…
    
    Before you start swiping,
    You should know that having an open mind alone won’t get you dates.
    
    If the pictures on your profile don’t stand out,
    You don’t know what openers to send,
    Or you can’t turn texts into real-life dates,
    Then you probably won’t have much success on the apps.
    
    So if you’d like to learn all my dating app secrets to turn your profile into a woman magnet,

They told me going to college was the safe option for a good life,
but did it turn out that way?

I tried dropshipping while pursuing a finance major…
I didn’t get many results…
so I quit and got a “real job”.

But I was miserable.

Having to go into the office every day…
surrounded by four blank walls…
staring at a computer screen…
I felt like my soul was being sucked out of my body.

This changed during one summer week.

A friend had a wedding in Paris,
but my boss wouldn’t let me take the days off.

That was the breaking point.

In the next month,
I put in my 2 weeks' notice,
moved to Barcelona,
got a 9-5 retail job,
and restarted dropshipping.

The result after 2 years?

I’m able to enjoy a sunny afternoon surfing the waves without worrying about money.

Sometimes, all it takes is a single moment to change your life,
one where you say:
‘I’m going to change my life,
and I won’t stop until I’m successful.’

So that was my story,
but now, I want to know more about you.

Comment what goals you’re currently working on👇.
I’d love to hear them.

    The 6 biggest mistakes to AVOID as a new language learner
    
    INTRO
    “I’ve learned 20 languages over 50 years…
    Avoid these mistakes and you’ll reach conversational fluency sooner.”
    
    MISTAKE #1: “Too difficult”
    No language is impossible—time-to-fluency differs by distance from your native language.
    
    MISTAKE #2: Not listening enough
    Early audio feels like noise. Keep listening anyway.
    Noise → comprehensible speech over time.
    
    MISTAKE #3: Trying to memorize everything
    Don’t brute-force rules. Notice patterns in context.
    
    MISTAKE #4: Speaking too early
    Speak when you want, but prioritize comprehension first.
    
    MISTAKE #5: Staying in beginner content too long
    Move to content you actually enjoy once you know ~500 common words.
    
    MISTAKE #6: Using flashcards too much
    Input matters most: attitude + time + noticing.
    Vocabulary sticks through repeated context.
    
    CONCLUSION
    Avoid the 6 mistakes, but the key is finding time.
    Lead into a follow-up video on time management tips.</pre>
    
            <p class="note" style="margin-top:12px;">
              Strength: Clear authority framing, friction-reducing advice, and a smooth bridge to the next video
              (session time → retention → binge path).
