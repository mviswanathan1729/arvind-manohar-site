You see:

There’s a reason why there are 14-year-olds making thousands each day,

While you’re making less than $10k/mo while working long hours at your day jobs.

It’s because these young children have discovered something that most adults will never realize…

The internet gives everyone an equal chance to make money online no matter where you are in life.

For example,

English isn’t my first language,

I dropped out of college in my second year,

And I’m a woman.

But despite this,

I was able to start a side hustle that profits 7 figures each year.

I call it the “Automated Income AI System”,

And it works by creating and selling your own digital products online.

Now, if you’re still watching this Ad,

You’re probably serious about making a lot of girl money online.

So at this point,

You need to make a decision.

You can either go to college for 4 years just to work at a 9-5 you’re probably going to hate.

OR

Hustle for 2 years to make a 7-figure income working 3 hours per day.

If you chose the second option,

My 5-step roadmap to build an “Automated Income AI System” will help you achieve those goals.

It has all the information I wish I had when first starting this side hustle.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

With this guide, you’ll know how to finally quit your 9-5 and get the attention and money you deserve.

Are you tired of working at your unfulfilling 9-5 job?

Taking on extra projects, working unpaid overtime, not using your vacation days,

But despite all that hard work you’re putting in,

You’re not getting the credit or pay that you deserve.

If you feel like this,

Then I can help you out.

My name’s Hannah,

And I help women make an extra $1k+/day in passive income with just a lunch break's worth of work,

So they can finally start living their best girly lives.

With the AI business model that I teach,

I’ve generated over seven figures in profit over the last two years.

With that extra money and freedom,

I’ve been able to move to Dubai, travel to over 20 countries, and see my friends almost every day.

And now, I want to help you do the same.

That’s why I’m giving you a 5-step income system roadmap.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

‘I’m so happy another man bought me this car.

I could never buy a car like this because I’ve never worked a day in my life.’

Many people believe this is what I’m thinking each day,

But it’s not true.

I bought all my cars, houses, and luxury trips with my hard-earned money.

How?

Well, I used to work at a 9-5 while only making $6k/mo,

But started a unique side hustle a little under 2 years ago,

And I’ve scaled it to make me over $100k/mo.

And no,

I didn’t start a clothing brand or become an affiliate marketer,

And I never had to take off a single piece of clothing.

This side hustle is called AI income automation,

And you create and sell your own digital products.

This means you’ll never have to worry about stocking inventory or having good profit margins.

And with the help of AI,

90% of the process is automated,

So you can make all this money while barely working 2 hours per day.

So how can you get started?

Well, it took me 6 months to start making $30k/mo,

But I’ve seen people scale to that income in just 3 months.

To help you make $1k/mo+ in passive income in as little time as possible,

I created a 5-step income system roadmap.

It guides you through the entire process, from choosing the best niche to marketing your products well.

With this guide, you’ll know how to finally quit your 9-5 and get the attention and money you deserve.

          <pre class="copy">Attention fitness coaches…

If you’re struggling to find qualified leads,

Then this funnel might be one of the best solutions going into 2025.

It’s called the “AR” funnel.

And it has helped over 500 fitness coaches make an additional $20k/mo from the extra customers.

The funnel works by attracting ready-to-buy leads for your business,

And ultimately get a recurring subscription so large that you may not need to run Ads to make money.

Best of all, it’s a fully automatic done-for-you funnel that can be installed for just a one-time payment.

If you’d like our help to install the “AR” funnel into your fitness business to help you attract more qualified leads,

Click the ‘Learn More’ button below to see if we’re a good fit for each other.

This is the perfect opportunity going into the New Year.

More people are setting fitness goals,

Deciding to finally get in shape,

And looking into buying fitness programs.

So this is the best time to optimize your lead-generation system.

No other time in the year has more people looking to invest in fitness coaches than now.

So don’t miss out on the value this funnel can provide.

          <pre class="copy">If you’re a fitness coach looking to make more money,

Then this video is for you.

There’s a system fitness coaches are using to make 10-20% more revenue each month.

And they don’t need to search for new leads,

Increase their prices,

Or buy premade lead lists.

In fact, once this system is installed in a fitness business,

The owner can generate income without even lifting a finger.

And that is…

A referral system.

Yes, this is what thousands of personal trainers are currently sleeping on.

Think about it…

You trust your friends and family,

So if they recommend a personal trainer,

You’ll take their word for it because you know they have good intentions for you.

These referrals are more often qualified leads ready to invest in themselves.

A referral system can create additional revenue while having low maintenance.

And that’s why I made it the main priority to include in my “AR” funnel.

It’s a fully DFY sales funnel to not only attract more qualified leads,

But it also includes a referral system to potentially increase your MRR by 10-20%.

You can get all this for a one-time payment.

So if you’re ready to see if the “AR” funnel is a right fit based on your specific business,

We’ll analyze your business’s current situation,

Give you advice to scale based on where you’re at,

This usually happens for 3 main reasons:

The brands are running ads that barely break even,

The business is struggling to find leads who actually want to invest in their services,

And they rely on cold outreach and inconsistent ad campaigns to survive.

But what if you didn’t have to?

What if you could consistently attract high-paying clients without spending a dime on ads?

That’s where the “AR” funnel comes in.

          <pre class="copy">Hook: Hair loss and heart attacks have one scary thing in common: the longer you wait, the worse it gets.

Doctors often talk about how with heart attacks, the sooner you get help, the better your chances of survival.

And the thing is…

Your scalp works the same way.

Hair loss isn't just some "cosmetic thing".

It's a sign that your follicles are starving,

That blood circulation's down,

And that the environment on your scalp isn't ideal for your hair to grow.

And if you wait?

Those follicles can go dormant and begin to die,

Making it much harder for your hair to get back to looking its best.

I'm not trying to scare you.

I just wish someone had told me this earlier.

Because I waited.

I kept covering my hair with hats.

And even though I'd see less and less hair whenever I took my hat off,

I kept telling myself I was "overthinking it".

I made the mistake of waiting too long to fix my hair loss problem,

And now, it'll take me around 6 months longer to get my ideal results.

So don't wait until your hairline has already started receding.

The sooner you start treating this problem, the quicker your hair will grow.

The best solution I found was ______.

It's designed to block DHT and create an ideal environment for hair to grow in.

It's 100% natural. No hormones. No sketchy side effects.

Just ingredients like:

______ to increase blood flow to your follicles.

______ to cleanse the scalp of impurities.

And ______ to inhibit the DHT in your body.

Plus, if you're not seeing results? There's a 90-day money-back guarantee.

Click the "Shop now" button below to start treating your hair loss over the long term.

If you're having mild hair loss,

Then the 3-pack would work well for you.

But if you've started losing a lot of hair,

The 6-pack of shampoo would likely be your best option.

Not only would you prevent yourself from running out before seeing results,

But you'd also get a massive discount buying the shampoo in a bundle.</pre>

          <pre class="copy">Hook: Would you wait for a heart attack to start caring about your heart? Then don't wait to go bald to start caring about your scalp.

Look, I get it…

When hair starts thinning, it's easy to just ignore it, tell yourself it's stress, or maybe no one else notices.

But deep down, you know that sinking feeling every time you look in the mirror.

Or wear hats indoors and hope no one asks why.

But here's the thing:

In the same way that you have a higher chance of surviving a heart attack if it's treated early,

You're more likely to treat hair loss when you act early.

That's why ______ can be the perfect shampoo to help your scalp start growing hair again.

______ helps every man with hair loss.

It doesn't matter if you see the first signs or if you only have a couple of strands left.

The difference is the time it takes to get it back.

Simply use ______ 5 times per week for long-lasting results without the side effects or high costs of traditional treatments.

Hair takes time to heal and grow,

And treating your scalp consistently is what will help you see results in the long term.

Plus, you'll save money. avoid running out halfway through, and can take advantage of the 90-day, no-questions-asked guarantee.

Look, it's simple:

The longer you wait, the worse your hair loss will get.

If you're having mild hair loss,

Then the 3-pack would work well for you.

But if you've started losing a lot of hair,

The 6-pack of shampoo would likely be your best option.

So don't overthink it.

Hair loss works the same way.

Sounds dramatic, I know.

But it's true.

When someone has a heart attack, timing is everything.

Every minute that goes by, more damage is done to the tissue.

And it's the same with your hair.

When you start noticing the extra hairs on your pillow when you wake up in the morning, 

Your scalp is sending out a signal that it needs to be treated as soon as possible.

And if you act fast?

You've got a good shot at waking them back up.

But if you wait, those follicles will start shutting down.

You can still grow healthy hair,

But the only difference is that it will potentially take months longer to see results.

That's why ______  hit me so hard.

Because it's built for early intervention.

The shampoo works by blocking DHT, strengthening the hair follicles, and stimulating blood flow to the scalp.

And the best part?

It's 100% natural, doesn't cause any side effects, and creates an ideal environment for hair to grow in.

I noticed only a few hairs falling out after a couple of months.

That's why I always say if you're gonna try ______,

I'd recommend you get the 6-bottle bundle.

That's the amount your hair needs to start seeing results after consistent use.

And hey, if you don't like it?

There's a 90-day 100% money-back guarantee, no questions asked.

This means that your hair has almost nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Sounds crazy, but it's true.

With cardiac arrest, every second matters.

Wait too long, and the damage to your heart tissue will be harder to fix.

Hair loss works on a similar principle.

You see, your scalp has thousands of little hair follicles.

They don't all just fall out one day: they weaken and are eventually unable to start producing hair again.

But here's the thing:

If you act early, you can revive them.

If you don't? 

They die off… and it may take much longer to start growing healthy, thick hair.

And so if you start early,

The best solution I've found to combat hair loss is ______.

Because it's designed to treat the problem at the root, literally.
It goes deep, clearing the blockages and feeding your hair the important nutrients it needs to grow again.

______ contains ______  to bring blood back to the scalp, Plant-based DHT blockers to detox the follicles, and herbal extracts like ______ and ______ to stimulate fresh hair growth.

And because it works best if you're consistent over a few weeks or months,

If your hair looks something like this [insert image],

I'd recommend getting the pack of 3.

If your hair looks more like this [insert image],

I'd recommend getting the pack of 6.

That's how you can save money while avoiding potentially running out in the middle.

Remember: whether it's your heart or your hair, it doesn't matter.

          </div>
          <pre class="copy">When my doctor prescribed me Finasteride, he said to just take the pill once per day and to find a way to deal with the potential side effects. What he didn't mention were the potential side effects that might never go away, even after stopping the medication.
I discovered this the hard way. Six months into treatment, I noticed changes such as decreased libido, difficulty concentrating, and a persistent brain fog that affected my work performance. My hair marginally improved while all other aspects of my life deteriorated. 
But when the depression became too much to handle, I finally decided to stop taking the pills, expecting my body to return to normal within weeks, but it didn't.
I did some research on the internet and learned about Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS) -  a condition where Finasteride's side effects last long after stopping using the drug. Forums were filled with men sharing similar experiences, some suffering for years after their last dose.
I was terrified. Had I permanently damaged my health for the sake of my hairline? Thankfully, I hadn't and the symptoms went away after a few more weeks, but I knew I needed to find an alternative solution.
After doing a lot of research, I discovered _____. It works by gently removing buildup that suffocates follicles while blocking DHT with natural ingredients like _____. And the best part is that this shampoo doesn't cause any side effects.
The difference was remarkable. Within weeks of switching, my scalp was cleaner, and I was seeing less hair on my comb. Within 3 months, my hair was actually thicker than when I was on the prescription. And after 6 months, my doctor complimented how full and healthy my hair was looking.
Right now, you can get the 6-month supply of _____ at a 66% discount. This ensures you won't run out in the middle of your hair regrowth journey. And it's completely risk-free with _____'s 90-day money-back guarantee.

          <pre class="copy">It's 10 PM on a Tuesday. I'm standing in my bathroom, exhausted after a long day, checking my hair loss calendar to confirm what torture awaits me tonight. It looks like today's Minoxidil day. The itching it causes is extremely irritating. It feels like mosquito bites you can't scratch. 
Tomorrow won't be much better, though. The stinging, the redness, and the occasional bleeding were all tough to deal with, but I thought that was just the cost of regrowing my hair.
But the worst part is that after 3 months of this, all I had to show for it was a collection of half-used products, a permanently irritated scalp, and hair that was marginally – if at all – improved.
I was about to give up entirely when my cousin visited for the weekend. The same cousin who, last year, had been noticeably balder than I. Now, he had a full, thick head of hair that looked completely natural.
He didn't have any painful procedures or expensive treatments. He said he just used _____.
I was skeptical but desperate, so I tried it. The difference was immediate. Instead of pain, I felt a refreshing tingling sensation. The natural ingredients like _____, _____, and _____ cleaned my scalp and created an ideal environment for hair to grow in. At the same time, _____ blocked DHT, so my hair follicles could start producing healthy hair again.
After 3 months, I started seeing more growth on my temples. And after 6 months, people were actually commenting on how much thicker my hair looked.
For the best results, I recommend getting the 6-month supply of _____, which comes with an amazing 66% discount. This ensures you won't run out in the middle of your regrowth journey.

          <pre class="copy">Hook: I used to think my thinning hair was due to bad genetics.
When I first went to see my dermatologist, he offered the usual solutions like daily pills that would irritate my scalp and affect my performance in the bedroom. But at the time, I thought those were the only options. I either had to deal with losing hair or the other side effects.
But one day, I was watching a documentary when I found out something I wish I knew sooner: the real culprit behind most hair loss isn't just your family tree – it's DHT, a hormone that attaches to your hair follicles and gradually chokes them until they can't produce healthy hair anymore. If you find a way to block DHT and get your follicles the bloodflow and nutrients they need, you'll likely start growing hair again.
I looked into the pills I was taking and found that they were just covering up the problem instead of solving the root cause. So I did some research to see if I could find a more effective solution, and  I discovered the _____. Instead of adding another step to my routine, it replaced something I was already doing – washing my hair.
The plant-based formula contains _____ that blocks DHT and _____ to give your follicles the nutrients they need. This created the optimal environment for new hair growth without the side effects of prescription medications.
Within 8 weeks, I noticed significantly less shedding. By week 12, I could see actual regrowth in areas that had been thinning for years. And after 6 months, my wife actually complimented how good my hair looked.
Right now, you can get a 6-month supply of _____ at 66% off the regular price – fully protected by a 90-day money-back guarantee.

Dialogue: "This was my life… every single day. Who was the culprit?"

Scene 2
Visual: Quick shot of cat looking guilty near the litter box. Shocked music in the background
Text Overlay: "The culprit."

Scene 3
Visual: Actor selfie-style, holding Catalyst bag. Cat walking in the background.
Dialogue: "I must confess: my apartment always used to smell like straight-up cat poop, but it doesn't anymore."

Scene 4
Visual: Actor pours Catalyst into a litter box. Close-up of clean wood texture.
Dialogue: "That's because I switched to Catalyst litter, and here are three reasons why I'll never go back."

Scene 5
Visual: "Before" shot: actor spraying air freshener, waving hand at nose. "After" shot: cat walking across the floor, actor sniffing the air in relief.
Dialogue: "First, this cat litter has way better odor control. My previous cat litter always left that sour, wet-cement smell that never really went away, no matter how much I scooped.
With Catalyst, I couldn't smell a thing. When guests would come over, they actually didn't know I even had a cat until seeing her walk by."

Scene 6
Visual: "Before" shot: Actor pouring clay litter → big dust cloud. Coughing exaggeratedly.
"After" shot: Actor scooping Catalyst clump → comes out without dust going everywhere.
Dialogue: "Second, my lungs and my cat's lungs are far happier now. Clay turns into gross, dusty cement at the bottom. I'd cough, she'd sneeze, and scraping cement off the bottom of the pan was always such a nightmare."
But with Catalyst, there aren't any dust clouds. Pouring it is so much easier."

Scene 7
Visual: Box delivered to the doorstep. The actor pretends to flex her muscles while lifting the Catalyst bag with one hand. Then the scene shows her wobbling comically while lifting a heavy clay box with both hands. 
Text overlay: "No gym required."
Dialogue: "Third, it's lighter to carry. Catalyst is made from upcycled wood instead of strip-mined clay. It actually breaks down instead of sitting in a landfill for a thousand years. So it's lighter and eco-friendly, unlike my old clay litter. That's a win-win."

Scene 8
Visual: Actor sitting relaxed on the couch with her cat.
Dialogue: "And all of these benefits come at an amazing price. Catalyst lasts way longer and is almost half the price of the clay junk I was paying for before."

"Bro, some dudes can't grow a full beard. It's just genetics, right?"
For years, I used to believe that.
[RELATABLE MOMENT]
I'd look in the mirror every morning, check if the sides were any more connected, and just shake my head.
No matter what I did, my beard never looked right to me. And honestly, it started to mess with my confidence. 
I didn't want to accept that mine could be patchy forever. But then I'd see comments online saying that "no product applied topically could alter my genetics," so I figured, what's the point?
[BUILD THE PAIN]
My beard was dry, itchy, uneven, and looked like it had given up on itself halfway through growing. I hated it.
I tried a bunch of products, but they either made my skin burn, smelled weird, or did absolutely nothing. Eventually, I got so frustrated that I was contemplating just shaving it all off.
[INTRODUCE THE SOLUTION]
But one day, I was talking to an old friend, and he told me about Respected Roots. It's a 3-step kit for your beard. The Foaming Co-Wash cleans your face without drying out your beard The Beard Oil hydrates and strengthens it, and the Beard Conditioner softens it and makes it look more even. It's a formula that keeps your beard healthy and helps it look fuller over time.
[EXPERIENCE]

It doesn't overpower my nose, but lingers just enough to be noticeable. Turns out my beard growth problems weren't due to genetics. I was just using the wrong product.

My girlfriend hates it when I do this beard routine to fix my patchy spots.
[SET THE SCENE]
Last week, we went out for dinner to a new spot. We sat down, and before we even got our drinks, the hostess started flirting with me, right in front of my girlfriend.
[CONTINUE THE STORY / BUILD HUMOR]
After dinner ended, while we were walking back to the car, this woman crossing the street stopped me, told me my beard looked super soft, and asked if she could touch it. My girlfriend looked like she wanted to slap that lady.


Later that night, we swung by a friend's house. And as soon as we walk in, he goes, "Bro, your beard's looking real good. What have you been using on it?" He didn't even acknowledge my girlfriend. She was just scrolling on her phone while my friend was asking me about my beard for most of the night. Later, she told me that she didn't ever want me using that routine again."
[SHARE THE JOURNEY / WHAT I TRIED BEFORE]
Now, you gotta understand that this is new for me. My beard used to be dry, patchy, and uneven. I tried all those random oils and YouTube hacks, but they either made my skin flare up or just didn't do anything.
[SHARE THE SOLUTION / "AHA" MOMENT]
But then, I discovered this 3-step beard care routine from Respected Roots. The Foaming Co-Wash cleans your face without drying out your beard. The Beard Oil helps strengthen it, and the Beard Conditioner reduces the appearance of patchiness.

            <p><strong>Mass Desire:</strong> To wake up feeling normal again after drinking, without guilt, bloating, or sluggishness, while also protecting long-term health.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Avatar:</strong> 32-year-old male, social drinker, busy professional. He wants rapid recovery after nights out, simple solutions, and peace of mind about his liver health.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Testing Rationale:</strong> This script uses a historical story to build curiosity, position Milk Thistle as an ancient secret, and make the supplement feel like a modern version of an effective solution the Romans used. This could perform well because it doesn't sound like a generic pill pitch.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #1:</strong> Ancient Romans would drink wine all night, eat like a king, then wake up ready to fight battles the next morning, and it was all because of a weird purple flower…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #2:</strong> After drinking copious amounts of alcohol, ancient Roman soldiers recovered as if nothing had happened with this strange purple flower you've probably never heard of…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #3:</strong> Historians used to be puzzled by how Roman soldiers were able to fight without collapsing after nights of heavy drinking and feasting. That was until they found out about this weird purple flower…</p>
          </div>

          <pre class="copy">In 69 AD, also known as the Year of the Four Emperors, Italy was devastated by its civil war. Battles stretched across the empire, from the hills of Rome to the distant rural areas.

Roman soldiers were fighting all day with brutal intensity. Thousands were marching on little to no sleep.

But here's the part that used to confuse historians. At the end of those grueling days, those soldiers had large feasts and drank goblets of strong wine, often until late into the night. The celebrations were as fierce as the battles themselves.

Yet, by dawn, they were back in formation, marching and fighting like normal. How was that possible? Well, the Romans had a secret weapon that came from a plant.

Roman healers noticed something strange. A group of soldiers who consumed a certain spiky purple flower seemed to recover quicker than those who didn't. While others groaned with pain, feeling heavy with bloating and nausea from the wine and food, the men who consumed this plant had more energy, felt lighter, and were ready for battle sooner.

The healers began experimenting. They crushed the seeds, brewed them in teas, and even ground them into powders to mix with food and drink. And time after time, the soldiers who ate the flower felt lighter, stronger, and more alert.

Over months, the plant developed a reputation. Commanders quietly encouraged their troops to consume it after nights of heavy drinking.

That plant was Milk Thistle, and it wasn't just soldiers who used it. After the war ended, Roman citizens brought it into their homes. Physicians documented it in their medical texts. And later, medieval healers called it the "protector of the liver." And to be clear, this wasn't some kind of fad. It was evidence-based proof that was recorded, respected, and trusted across centuries.

So why don't most people know about this? Why isn't it in every doctor's office and pharmacy?

Because here's the uncomfortable truth. You can't patent a plant. And if you can't patent it, you can't make billions selling it as a prescription drug.

So while the studies piled up in journals and scientists were confirming Milk Thistle's ability to detoxify the liver, the wider medical world turned a blind eye.

There wasn't much money to be made in trying to sell a solution that nature already solved.

Instead, attention shifted to creating solutions that could be patented and sold at a premium. Solutions that mask symptoms were promoted more than ones that targeted the root cause.

I mean, think about how most people handle liver stress today. They drink coffee after a night out to cover fatigue. They grab antacids when their stomach feels bloated the night after drinking. They pop painkillers for their stomach pain.

But none of those addresses the real issue:  Having a liver that's clogged and overworked from modern living.

During all this time, Milk Thistle stayed in the shadows.

But not everyone forgot about it. Over the years, researchers kept circling back to it. They ran trials on patients with liver stress. They documented improvements. And they measured enzyme levels dropping back toward normal ranges.

And slowly, the picture became clearer. This was science that had been ignored because it wasn't profitable.

Modern science has finally caught up with what those ancient healers already knew. Scientists recently discovered that Milk Thistle contains a compound called Silymarin. This compound helps the liver flush out toxins more effectively and supports the regeneration of liver cells.

That's why soldiers could recover so quickly. Their livers were being restored while they rested. And that's why people who use it today notice clearer energy, lighter digestion, and fewer of those heavy, toxic mornings.

But there's something that the ancients didn't know. The Silymarin didn't work in isolation. It got help from other key ingredients.

Roman soldiers ate lots of oranges shipped across the empire. These oranges were a huge source of their Vitamin C. Today, modern science confirms it enhances overall vitality and immune defense, giving the body resilience.

Ancient diets also often included plant extracts that soothed digestion and kept the gut in balance. Scientists now know that pairing Milk Thistle with digestive-friendly compounds helps reduce bloating and discomfort even more effectively.

So what happens when you bring those allies together, in the right combination, in the right amounts?

You get a formula that actually improves on what the Romans had.

That's what SerraNaturals Milk Thistle Support does. It's a clean, natural formula built around the same Milk Thistle ingredient Romans relied on to recover. It's also paired with Vitamin C, plant-based extracts, and other complementary nutrients that modern research has shown to support energy, digestion, and resilience.

So instead of waking up groggy and sluggish after a night out, you could wake up with clear energy. Instead of random bloating after heavy meals, your digestion could feel light and comfortable. And instead of worrying quietly about the long-term damage of alcohol or toxins, you could feel confident you're supporting your body where it matters most.

And it doesn't require a radical lifestyle change either. You don't have to quit drinking or starve yourself with cleanses. You just have to take 1 pill each day. That's it. And because all the ingredients are natural, you don't have to worry about any crazy side effects.

To make this discovery accessible to as many people as possible, SerraNaturals is offering 11% off on their 90-day supply right now. But because of the high demand, they don't know how much longer they'll be able to offer it at that price.

So if you'd like to give your body the same advantage Roman soldiers carried into battle, and feel what it's like to live lighter, clearer, and stronger every single day. This is your chance to finally do that.

            <p><strong>Avatar Targeted:</strong> Women 40+, menopausal or post-menopausal, tired of bloating, weight gain, and feeling like their body betrayed them. Especially those scared of prescriptions like Ozempic.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Testing Rationale:</strong> This ad throws stones at the other weight loss options for menopausal women (Ozempic, fat burners, keto) and contrasts Lipozem as the safe, easy, sustainable option that doesn't cause side effects. This ad is for a solution-aware audience.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #1:</strong> I finally lost my menopausal belly, and I didn't do it the way you'd expect…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #2:</strong> There's a way to lose post-menopausal weight you probably don't know about…</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hook #3:</strong> Here's how I finally lost weight after 40 without Ozempic, keto, or endless workouts…</p>
          </div>

          <pre class="copy">I heard about and tried dozens of marketed solutions, but none of them appealed to me.

Ozempic seemed to work for many women, but the side effects, like nausea, bloating, and stomach problems, deterred me from trying it. Also, many women reported that those side effects didn't actually ever go away, even after they stopped taking the medication. I tried fat burners before, too, but the jitters and crashes made me feel worse than before I tried them. I also tried Keto, but I always ended up regaining the weight I worked so hard to lose. It just wasn't a sustainable solution over the long term.

I was frustrated by not being able to find a solution without any side effects. I didn't want to have to choose between losing weight and dealing with other health issues.

I was almost ready to give up, but after a lot of research, I eventually discovered Lipozem.

It uses all-natural clinical-grade salts like Magnesium, Calcium, and Sodium that help your body break down fat, turn it into energy, and eliminate fatigue, along with those nonstop cravings.

And the best part: it doesn't contain any caffeine, require any needles, or come with any nasty side effects because all the ingredients are natural. You just have to take two capsules per day.

The women in the reviews were calling it life-changing. They were saying things like "My cravings are gone." "I finally fit into my old jeans again." "I feel energized and in control."

And that's exactly how I feel now.

The only problem? Every time word gets out about their 70% discount on the 5-pack, bottles sell out fast. And when they're gone, it can take weeks before they're back in stock.

So if you want a safe way to flatten your belly, feel energized, and finally get control of your body again without risking permanent side effects, click the 'learn more' below to try Lipozem today at the cheapest price it'll ever be at.</pre>

        <pre class="copy">Subject Line: Here’s why you should date 4 women
Preview Text: Not what you think…

%FIRSTNAME%,

If you’re not a modern sheik in today’s world,

And you’re not dating at least 4 women at once…

Then what are you doing?

Now, I might sound like a misogynist when I say that,

But hear me out.

<img src="images/promo-email1.png" alt="Promo Email Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

These 4 girlfriends that you have shouldn't exist in real life,
But rather your imagination.

What do I mean by this?
Acting like you're dating four girls will solve many of your needy problems.

Think about it:
If you were dating 4 women,
Would you care if one of them didn’t text you back or cancelled plans at the last minute?
Would it be a big deal if one of the relationships didn’t work out?

Chances are you wouldn’t be too upset because you’d have other options.

When you don’t put all your faith into one person,
You’ll seem less needy and more confident,
Which will make you more attractive to the woman you’re dating.

So %FIRSTNAME%,
Next time you feel a certain way about a girl,
Then just ask yourself…
‘Would I feel this way if I had 4 girlfriends?’

If the answer is no,
Then it means you’re being needy and need to change your behavior.

Now, you may be wondering:
‘This all sounds good,
But what can I do not to act desperate?’

Well, if that’s the case,
I’ve taught hundreds of men the blueprint not to be needy.

Preview Text: Here’s how…

It’s true %FIRSTNAME%,
The ugly baby concept is preventing IG growth.

And it’s not for the reason you think.

I know, the name might sound weird,
But hear me out.

The idea refers to when a creator thinks their work is high-quality,
But a viewer thinks it’s terrible.

It’s the same reason why a toddler thinks he drew the next Mona Lisa
even though he just scribbled all over the paper.

As creators,
We know how much effort we put into the content,
So we’re biased to thinking the reels are better than they actually are.

This is why we may spend 5 hours creating a reel,
Only for it to get 11 likes.

Now %FIRSTNAME%,
I’ve found that the best way to prevent this from happening…
To have an expert to critique your content.

Not only can they provide unbiased feedback,
But they can also give advice on how to improve in the future.

So despite the funny name,
The ugly baby concept could be the reason your social media isn’t growing as fast as you’d like.

And if you’d like access to an expert who can give you constant feedback,

Preview Text: Not what you think…

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

It was December 25, 2006.
I checked my mailbox and saw that I’d gotten a Christmas card from my dentist.

The message read “Happy Holidays, brush twice a day, floss regularly!”

Why am I telling you this?

Many of your conversations with women are like my dentist's Christmas card:
Boring, generic, and templated.

Do you think you’ll create an unforgettable impression by saying…
“I like your outfit.”
“What do you do for work?”
“The weather’s nice today.”

The truth is…
She’ll see you as just another random guy with no personality.

That’s why when you speak to a woman,
You should focus more on making her emotional.

Crack a witty joke,
Playfully tease her,
You could even tell her she’s fatter than the sun.
(Although I don’t recommend that 😂)

So next time you speak to a woman,
Don't be like my dentist's Christmas card.

Invoke strong emotions,
And she’ll get hooked to you.

Now with all that being said,
I have to make an important disclaimer…

Although the exact phrases you say to her are important,
They alone won’t make her feel emotional.

You need to have open body language,
Master small talk to avoid having dry conversations,
And know how to have good conversations over text.

That’s why in my 3-month coaching program,
You’ll not only learn how to speak to women to become a walking chick magnet,
But you’ll also get access to
My fiercely guarded PREMIUM seduction secrets to become irresistibly attractive to women.
Exclusive coaching calls to learn texting basics, bedroom mastery, and everything in between.
Access to my Brotherhood Facebook group to get so many dates you can’t fit them all on your calendar.

As a bonus,
If you haven’t been on any dates after the 3 months,
You can stay in the program for FREE until you do.

There’s going to be a huge discount.

But despite being irritating,
The messages teach an important lesson on how NOT to build a brand on IG.

Think about it…
Did you enjoy seeing those spammy unpersonalized messages?

You probably just ignored them, and for good reason.

The thing is %FIRSTNAME%…
People hate being sold to.

Ads are so common nowadays.
You’re probably tired of seeing them in every corner of the internet.

That’s why people more than ever before crave genuine and approachable brands,
As opposed to ones that are constantly hard-selling.

To make sure your brand falls into the first category,
You need to do the following:
Be authentic and share your personality so your target audience can easily connect with you.
Make the content engaging so people look forward to your posts.
Give actionable value so your audience sees you as the go-to authority in your niche.

By implementing these tips,
Your content will engage your target audience better.

Preview Text: 8 years of dating experience inside

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Do you tend to stay home and keep to a small circle of friends?
If so, you’re just like me when I was 20.

I would play video games all day without talking to anyone.
I was so shy that my hands used to shake uncontrollably whenever I’d talk to women.

Every time I’d talk to one at the grocery store,
I’d have a nervous breakdown and stutter and look like an idiot.

It got to the point where even going out in public was hard sometimes.
I didn’t know if I’d ever be able to get rid of my social anxiety.

But after a few months, just by implementing 3 new habits,
I found that I was not only able to overcome my social anxiety,
But also turn on my ‘extrovert switch’ whenever necessary.

Here are 3 things I did to overcome my social anxiety about talking to women.

1. Say ‘yes’ whenever you’re invited somewhere.
Even if the activity bored me to tears,
I’d show up to get more chances to leave the house and talk to people.

Women can sense if you haven’t talked to anyone in months,
So give yourself as many opportunities to socialize as possible.

2. Leave your house for at least 20-30 minutes every day.
It doesn’t matter where you go as long as you talk to everyone you see.

I started doing this when I was 20,
And I’m still consistent with it at 28 years old.

I just make simple comments like…
“Hey, how’s your day going?”
“I like your glasses.”
“You have a cool outfit.”

Regularly talking to everybody will make you more comfortable around women.

3. Go to a nightlife venue at least once per week.
Stay sober the entire time and talk to as many people as possible.

It might feel uncomfortable being around drunk people,
But if you drop any judgment, you’ll enjoy yourself more.

Use what I call the ‘anti-drunk method’.
Drunk people don’t care what others think,
So you need to do the same.

Once you start letting loose while speaking,
You’ll come off as more likable.

Those are 3 life-changing habits you can apply to your daily life.

Even though I don’t have difficulties talking to women anymore,
I still follow these habits because they help me feel more confident,
And I’m sure they’ll help you too.

Rooting for you.

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

If you offer coaching, consulting, or run a DFY agency,
Then you’re probably familiar with the following…

Cold calling for 3 hours without reaching a single interested prospect.
Sending 2000 emails without finding any warm leads.
Paying thousands for a course only for it to be filled with generic templates.

These experiences aren't enjoyable for most people.
You usually need to spend days outreaching before seeing results.

And we all know what that feels like…

<img src="images/urgency-email1.png" alt="Urgency Email Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

But I spoke to my friend Adam recently,
And he came up with a new way to get qualified leads for his agency.

He calls his new method the “2-step Webinar Cracker”,
And he got 35% of his contacts to join his agency as a result of it.

He’s also taught hundreds of other people how to use this framework,
And many of them have hit their first 30k, 50k, and even 100k+ month because of it.

Unlike other ‘gurus’ who may charge 15k for their frameworks,
Adam and I will be showing you how this method works in a F.R.E.E. 2-day live event.

The event will take place December 10-11 from 7-10 pm EST on both days.


Stay scaling,

P.S. Don’t worry, we won’t be selling you any courses during the event.

That’s like asking them to marry you without even getting on a call with them.

Some months ago,

My friends and I decided to throw on our helmets,

Zip up our biker jackets,

And ride our motorcycles on the highway together.

But believe it or not,

This experience taught me an important lesson about growing an online business.

Right as we were about to get going,

I couldn't get my bike to move.

I checked everything: the engine, fuel, throttle,

All those things were on point.

I couldn't figure out why the motorcycle wasn't going anywhere.

I was about to wave my friends off when they all burst out laughing. 

One of them pointed and said, 

"Your shaft is in neutral dude, not in drive."

My face turned red as a tomato when I realized this,

But once I got moving with the wind in my face,

I realized something…

The gear shaft on my motorcycle is a lot like limiting beliefs in business.

It doesn't matter how powerful your bike is or how hard you rev the engine.

When set to neutral,

You're not going anywhere.

And the same principle applies to business.

You can have the best strategies and tools at your disposal, 

But if you constantly have thoughts like:

"I don't have enough time."

"Why would MY business be successful?"

"I'm too tired today."

Your business growth stagnates.

You may have the power and potential, 

But without changing gears, 

You'll go nowhere.

To fix this problem %FIRSTNAME%,

Start by recognizing which limiting beliefs are holding you back. 

Then, actively replace them with beliefs that align with your goals. 

Once you do this,

Your business will grow surprisingly quickly,

Especially if many other elements are working.

You got this,

SERIOUSLY? 

How could anyone possibly afford that?

I was FUMING inside.

The year was 2016 and I was working overtime as a nurse WHILE PREGNANT, just to qualify for maternity leave.

Then, as soon as my son was born,

BAM!

A $3,000 daycare bill slapped me across my face.

It was unbelievable,

I couldn't afford that enormous cost,

Despite thinking I did everything right:

I got good grades,

Graduated from university,

And got a 'high-paying' job helping other people.

But I was barely scraping by while being overworked.

I promised myself that one day,

I'd be able to provide for my family without missing a moment with my kids.

I went down the internet rabbit hole endlessly searching for a solution,

Until I eventually came across digital marketing.

It wasn't easy,

And it took a lot of time, energy, and effort from me,

But it was all worth it.

Just one year after starting,

I made my first 7-figures online,

More money than I'd made in 10 years as a nurse.

Since then, I've bought my dream house,

And I'm able to work my desired hours from the comfort of my own home,

While spending ample time with my children.

Digital marketing changed my life %FIRSTNAME%,

And the side hustle could change yours too.

Preview Text: Here's how it works…

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Here's a photo from our trip to Taiwan last summer.

<img src="images/story-email3.png" alt="Story Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

We spent 9 days in the beautiful country,

And had the time of our lives,

But were also taught an important lesson about making money online.

When we were planning the itinerary,

We were stuck between two amazing spots:

A national park with incredible views and a beach with insane waves.

But given the time constraint,

We couldn't enjoy both of them to the fullest extent.

We either had to spend the entire day in one place,

Or spend half the day in each.

We initially considered the latter,

But our inner entrepreneur caused us to change our minds at the last minute.

We decided to spend the whole day at the beach,

Which turned out to be the best decision we could've made.

Not only would the commute between them have wasted 3 hours,

But we surfed some of the biggest waves of our lives.

By choosing to stick with one option,

We accomplished more as opposed to juggling both,

And the same principle applies to picking a business.

Many people spread themselves too thin by hopping between business models,

Sacrificing everything and pushing themselves to their limits,

But not dedicating themselves enough to a single craft to see results.

The people who started making thousands per month quickly went deep,  not wide.

They picked one business model and stuck to it,

Eating, sleeping, and breathing it every hour of the day.

It takes time and dedication to see development,

But it's always worth it in the end.

And sure, you can start other ventures later on to diversify your income.

But it's not a good idea to juggle between multiple businesses all at once.

Build one, 

Grow it, 

Sustain it,

Then move into other avenues.

In contrast, with "shiny object syndrome",

You'll be miserable for several months without any achievements to show off in the end.

So pick ONE business model, 

And don't switch until you've found success.

You'll be able to take action sooner and waste less time trying to choose the "best" one.

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Congratulations on finishing the final week of the 3-month coaching program.

In the past 12 weeks, you learned how to…

Confidently approach women and make the best first impression to increase the number of dates you get,
Set up the perfect first date to tap into her psychology and build the most attraction possible,
Master the art of texting and seduce her without saying a single word,
Become a physical bedroom beast and give her the most pleasurable experience of her entire life.

At this point, you know more about women than 90% of men on the planet.

You've consumed a lot of content from me,

But now, I want to hear about you.

So I made this quick feedback form.

Feel free to let me know what you liked about the program and what can be improved.

I plan on releasing more trainings soon,

If you're interested in being a part of the next courses I release,

Click here to answer a few questions and help me help you.

Looking forward to reading your responses.

Your Friend,

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

I saw that you filled out the feedback form,

And I appreciate the honesty.

From your responses,

It seems like you enjoyed the 3-month program.

So to provide even more value,

And reward you for your commitment,

I'd like to show you something you've never seen before.

You see…

If you wanted to be able to confidently approach women and go on dates with them,

The 12-week program taught you everything you needed to know.

But if you want to find a lifelong partner,

You need to get past the talking stage.

Resolving conflicts, channeling your inner masculine energy, and maintaining a healthy connection are key in the later stages of a relationship.

These skills are completely different from cold-approaching women.

But here's the thing…

Most men aren't ready for them.

They're still pissing their pants at the mere thought of talking to a girl.

But since you've been consistently consuming the information I've provided,

It's clear that you have a more advanced knowledge of relationships.

So to help you take your dating life to the next stage,

I've released the new 3-month coaching program 2.0!

Inside, you'll not only get access to everything you'd get with the original program,

But you'll also unlock several more modules, including:

12 more weeks of training to smoothly transition to the serious stages and thrive with your longer-term girlfriends, 
Twice as many coaching calls to guide you through this new complex relationship stage,
Access to an exclusive 2.0 community with higher-level conversations and golden nuggets I don't drop anywhere else.

And that's not even scratching the surface.

Click here to learn more about the 3-month coaching program 2.0.

Hope to see you inside %FIRSTNAME%.

Your Friend,

        <pre class="copy">Subject Line: Here's why you should date 4 women
Preview Text: Not what you think…

%FIRSTNAME%,

If you're not a modern sheik in today's world,

And you're not dating at least 4 women at once…

Then what are you doing?

Now, I might sound like a misogynist when I say that,

But hear me out.

<img src="images/upsell-email3.png" alt="Upsell Email Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 10px 0;">

These 4 girlfriends that you have shouldn't exist in real life,

But rather your imagination.

What do I mean by this?

Acting like you're dating four girls will solve many of your needy problems.

Think about it:

If you were dating 4 women,

Would you care if one of them didn't text you back or cancelled plans at the last minute?

Would it be a big deal if one of the relationships didn't work out?

Chances are you wouldn't be too upset because you'd have other options.

When you don't put all your faith into one person,

You'll seem less needy and more confident,

Which will make you more attractive to the woman you're dating.

So %FIRSTNAME%,

Next time you feel a certain way about a girl,

Then just ask yourself…

'Would I feel this way if I had 4 girlfriends?'

If the answer is no,

Then it means you're being needy and need to change your behavior.

Now, you may be wondering:

'This all sounds good,

But what can I do not to act desperate?'

Well, if that's the case,

I've taught hundreds of men the blueprint not to be needy.

In 12 weeks, they've gone from struggling to set boundaries with their partner,

To thrive in their romantic relationships.

If you'd like access to this framework,

Reply to this email with the word "FOUR",

And I'll send it over to you.

Your friend,

    It may be because of this 1 big mistake I see many men make.
    
    [In this part, &lt;name&gt; wears a backward cap and acts like a guy swiping on an app.]
    
    “She’s an accountant?
    Nah, she’s probably boring.
    
    She’s wearing a cross in a photo?
    I’ll pass, I don’t want to date someone who’s extremely religious.
    
    She has a photo of herself on a farm?
    No thank you, I prefer to live in the city, so the relationship probably won’t work out.”
    
    [Back to being &lt;name&gt;.]
    
    Stop.
    
    Dating apps only show a tiny part of someone’s personality.
    
    You can’t know everything about a person just by looking at a couple of photos.
    
    Here’s the truth:
    
    That accountant you thought would be boring could be one of the funniest, most adventurous people you ever met.
    
    That girl wearing the cross might not be religious.
    She may just be wearing it because her family does.
    
    And that woman on the farm could’ve just been visiting the place.
    She may like the city just as much as you do.
    
    The point is…
    
    You should avoid swiping solely based on surface-level judgments.
    
    Remove the filters,
    Have an open mind when you swipe on the apps.
    
    And you’ll be amazed at the people you might meet.
    
    But wait…
    
    Before you start swiping,
    You should know that having an open mind alone won’t get you dates.
    
    If the pictures on your profile don’t stand out,
    You don’t know what openers to send,
    Or you can’t turn texts into real-life dates,
    Then you probably won’t have much success on the apps.
    
    So if you’d like to learn all my dating app secrets to turn your profile into a woman magnet,

They told me going to college was the safe option for a good life,
but did it turn out that way?

I tried dropshipping while pursuing a finance major…
I didn’t get many results…
so I quit and got a “real job”.

But I was miserable.

Having to go into the office every day…
surrounded by four blank walls…
staring at a computer screen…
I felt like my soul was being sucked out of my body.

This changed during one summer week.

A friend had a wedding in Paris,
but my boss wouldn’t let me take the days off.

That was the breaking point.

In the next month,
I put in my 2 weeks' notice,
moved to Barcelona,
got a 9-5 retail job,
and restarted dropshipping.

The result after 2 years?

I’m able to enjoy a sunny afternoon surfing the waves without worrying about money.

Sometimes, all it takes is a single moment to change your life,
one where you say:
‘I’m going to change my life,
and I won’t stop until I’m successful.’

So that was my story,
but now, I want to know more about you.

Comment what goals you’re currently working on👇.
I’d love to hear them.

Because once you know my 3-step "VCP" framework for creating a YouTube channel in 2024, 

You'll see that this is the same method I used to successfully replace and exceed my 9-5 income, 

And it's also how hundreds of other people are scaling on YouTube quicker than with traditional methods. 

The first step of the "VCP" framework will show you how to reach the most people in the least amount of time with your videos. 

The second step will show how to get people to actually watch your videos the entire way through, 

And the third step will help you make the most amount of money possible on autopilot from every view that you get.


Who am I?

But before I reveal this framework, 

Why should you listen to me? 

Well, my name is <name>, 

And I've managed to grow my YouTube channel to make over $100k/mo in passive income. 

But it didn't come without its difficulties. 

You see, after graduating from college,

I started working for Deloitte, one of the top consulting firms in the United States. 

The job paid well, 

But from the first day, 

I knew it wasn't for me. 

Having to go into the office every day at set hours was never something I was a fan of. 

I was living in New York at the time, 

And honestly, 

I hated it. 

I thought it was too expensive and that the winters were too cold for my personal preference. 

Since I was 13, 

I remember wanting to live in Madeira, a tropical island off the coast of Portugal. 

But with having to go to an office every day to do my job, I realized that with this path,

I'd never be able to live in my dream location. 

So I started looking for ways to make money online. 

I stumbled across YouTube entrepreneurship as I went down the internet rabbit hole, 

So I decided why not, I'll give it a chance. 

I put my head down and worked on my YouTube channel every minute that I wasn't at my consulting job. 

After 2 years, I scaled my channel to $10k/mo. 

I was able to quit the job I so strongly detested, 

Move to Madeira with my husband, 

And maintain the income while working 2-4 hours per day. 

I could spend the afternoons hanging out with friends or watching a movie with my family. 

It was all thanks to being a YouTube entrepreneur. 

Although it took me 2 years, 

I believe that if I were to start over, 

I could do it in as little as 6 months. 

My goal is to help people hit $10k/mo in less time than it took me by providing tips I wish I'd had when starting, 

Including some common misconceptions I had that held me back in the beginning. 

So before I go in-depth on the VCP framework, 

Let me share the 4 biggest myths that people have about being a successful Youtuber that hold them back.


Value providing

The first myth is that you need the best equipment to attract views for your videos. 

It may be easy to think "All the big Youtubers I watch have these elaborate set-ups, 

So I must need one too to get big." 

But here's the catch: 

They didn't have these premium setups in the beginning. 

If you look at some of their oldest videos, 

You'll see that almost all popular Youtubers started with barebones setups. 

No fancy greenscreens or top-tier editing, 

Just them in front of a blank wall talking to the camera. 

This demonstrates that your setup doesn't need to be the best for you to start: 

It just needs to be good ENOUGH. 

Your video quality only needs to be good ENOUGH for people to see you clearly. 

Your sound quality only needs to be good ENOUGH for people to understand what you're saying. 

Your editing only needs to be good ENOUGH to make the video flow smoothly. 

As your channel grows and you start making money, 

You can upgrade the equipment you use if you'd like but don't think that you have to. 

For example, even after making over $100k/mo with YouTube, 

I still use my phone to record my videos, 

Just like I did at the start because I'm happy with its quality.

The second myth is that certain countries have advantages for growing on YouTube. 

People say to me a lot…

"Well, it was easy for you to grow your channel. You grew up in the United States. 

It's not possible to achieve your level of growth from somewhere else in the world." 

There are a few ways I typically respond to this. 

First of all, 

English wasn't my first language. 

Despite spending so much in the United States, 

I have a noticeable accent when I speak. 

The other factor is this: 

The internet allows people from anywhere in the world to access any piece of information they'd like, 

And that essentially puts all countries on a level playing field. 

From Anatoly in Belarus to David in Argentina, 

I've had students from all around the world make over $10k/mo with YouTube. 

They didn't use any special secret methods. 

They simply followed the necessary steps and practiced communicating well with their audiences. 

If they could do it, there's no reason you couldn't do it as well.

The third myth is that the best way to make money on YouTube is through ad revenue. 

When they start YouTube channels, 

They want to maximize their likes and views to increase the money they make from ads. 

This is what the path of a traditional "Youtuber" is like, 

But it's not the best strategy anymore because it takes much longer to make a full-time income. 

With less than 5k subscribers and barely 10k views at most per video, 

I was making $10k/mo on YouTube. 

But with traditional AdSense, 

You'd need between 800,000 and 5 million views per YouTube to even have a chance at making 5 figures per month. 

So what's the difference between me and traditional "Youtubers"? 

It's that I am a new-generation Youtuber, 

Also known as a "YouTube entrepreneur". 

Instead of focusing on the number of views I get, 

I care more about the quality of subscribers. 

I made content that was more on the educational than the entertainment side. 

Instead of making money through ads, 

I market and sell a separate product or service, 

Allowing me to generate more passive income than many channels that have 10x more subscribers than me.

The fourth myth is that making money on Youtube isn't possible anymore because Youtube is "oversaturated". 

Now this is only partially correct. 

Over 2 million hours of YouTube videos are indeed uploaded each day, 

But ask yourself this: 

Why are so many people on YouTube in the first place? 

It's because it's a good platform to grow and monetize an audience.

If YouTube wasn't a good option to grow your wealth online, 

Then people wouldn't be using it as a viable strategy. 

So the vast ocean of content creators proves that YouTube works well to make money online, 

Hence why so many people are trying their hand at creating content. 


Introduction to the unique system

Here's the catch though. 

It's effective, but not easy. 

If it were easy, 

Then everybody who's on YouTube would be making millions. 

But while there are channels like Pewdiepie that make over $1M every month, 

There are thousands of other channels with less than 500 subscribers making almost nothing. 

So to ensure you achieve success, 

You have to follow a tried-and-tested framework, 

Which is exactly what I'm about to show you now. 

My "VCP" framework is perfect for anyone who wants to be a "YouTube entrepreneur" and also happens to be exactly what I teach in the YouTube Intensive. 

It has helped people like Carlos monetize his YouTube channel to be able to quit his day job as a plumber, 

Or Steven make over $8k/mo with YouTube while he was still in high school. 

VCP stands for visibility-consumability-profitability.

So starting with the first step, 

Visibility. 

You want to pick a niche that's profitable AND that you know a lot about. 

So while you may be knowledgeable about a subject like knitting, 

It's going to be very hard to find a large audience who will pay for you to teach them how to knit. 

I make videos about growing on YouTube because that is a topic I know a lot about, 

But it doesn't mean that's the only good option. 

In the YouTube Intensive, not only do I share what the best niches are, 

But I also help you decide which one you should pick based on your interests and areas of knowledge. 

After picking a niche, 

You should start creating content. 

While doing so, 

You don't want just anybody to watch your videos. 

An ideal audience is interested in the subject you teach and is willing to spend the money to get better at it. 

Inside, I teach you how to position your channel to attract this group of people. 

Now the second step of the VCP framework is consumability because you don't want people to JUST watch your videos. 

Nobody's going to buy from a person after watching a single video from them. 

So what will make them want to buy? 

If you develop a KLT with them. 

KLT is the know, like, and trust factor. 

If you can position yourself as an expert in the field, 

As someone who knows the ins and outs and can answer all their questions, 

Your audience will be more than ready to invest in you. 

This KLT positioning is exactly what I will teach you how to do. 

The third step of the VCP framework is profitability. 

Now that you've grown an audience that trusts you, 

And is willing to buy from you, 

The final step is to attract them to your offer without being overly pushy or salesy. 

In the YouTube Intensive, 

I discuss the best marketing techniques to get a stream of qualified leads to work with. 

You'll also learn the best types of offers to create based on your personal brand.


A more in-depth description of the course

Not only will you be getting 24/7 access to myself and my team to answer any questions you may have, 

But you'll also be getting two free bonuses when you sign up. 

But before I explain what they are, 

I have to make a quick disclaimer first:

While being on YouTube can bring you success, 

There's one common pitfall you need to avoid, 

And that is copying someone else's format for creating videos. 

I did this for the first 3 months of my YouTube journey, 

And it was a complete waste of time. 

Think of it this way: 

If I printed T-shirts with the same white checkmark that Nike has, 

And tried to sell them, 

Would anybody buy them from me? 

No, of course not. 

Even if my shirts use the most comfortable fabric known to humankind, 

I still wouldn't sell any. 

Why? 

Because people don't buy Nike shirts because they like how the check mark looks. 

They buy because the check represents a prestigious brand that hundreds of athletes preach to get good results. 

In the same way, 

A YouTuber with over 10 million subscribers doesn't just run a successful channel. 

He's created a brand for himself, 

So copying him won't work for you. 

Instead, 

You should analyze their content and monetization system and understand why it works to generate views and dollars. 

Then take the principles and apply them to your own channel in a unique way. 

Doing this ensures that you use the best strategies without being a copy-paste channel.

Now, if you're extremely intelligent and have a keen eye for these kinds of social media trends, 

Then you may be able to do this on your own. 

But for the majority of people, 

Myself included when first starting, 

It's difficult to notice these kinds of patterns immediately. 

That's why as a bonus, 

You'll get my free guide with 100 of the most successful templates when it comes to YouTube channels. 

This way, you won't have to waste time figuring out how to create a profitable system for your channel, 

And can instead immediately start testing out different templates to see which one works best for you.

Additionally, you'll also get my free bonus 2-hour course on how to create a personal brand. 

You'll learn the 20 fundamentals that make a successful brand, 

And how to implement them into your brand to grow and monetize it depending on your circumstances.

Conclusion

So there you have it: 

The "VCP" framework for generating passive income with YouTube. 

Now, I want to present two options to you: 

You can either join a community of passionate learners with all your next steps laid out at every stage of the process, 

Where if you take advantage of it, 

You may end up like Ethan, 

Who managed to scale his Youtube channel to over $18k/mo in just 9 months thanks to the resources provided to him. 

Your other option is to try figuring all this out on your own, 

Which may take months or even years longer. 

As Alex Hormozi said, 

"You're paying the universe $1,000,000 every year for not knowing how to make $1,000,000 yourself." 

Social media algorithms and trends can change as often as every couple of weeks. 

You could try keeping up with all these changes yourself, 

Or join the Youtube Intensive, 

Where you'll be told exactly what the most recent changes are and how to adapt to them.  

With the resources provided, 

You're practically guaranteed to reach $10k/mo in months or even years faster than otherwise. 

By scrolling down below, 

You'll see hundreds of testimonials from my students demonstrating that.

But I have to warn you: 

Because of the intensity of the program, 

My team and I only have room for 12 more students. 

After these 12 spots fill up, 

If you want to join, 

You'll have to wait until the next cycle starts, 

Which could take a few months.

If you're still on the fence about joining, 

Then don't worry. 

By clicking the button to apply below, 

You'll be able to hop on a free call with me where you won't have to bring your wallet with you at all. 

I'll not only be providing you with valuable steps based on where you are in your YouTube journey,

But also determine if the program would be a good fit for you. 

So if you're interested, 

Click the link below and book a timeslot today before all the spots fill up. 

I can't wait to see you all inside and help you on your YouTube journey!</pre>

    Avoid these mistakes and you’ll reach conversational fluency sooner.”
    
    MISTAKE #1: “Too difficult”
    No language is impossible—time-to-fluency differs by distance from your native language.
    
    MISTAKE #2: Not listening enough
    Early audio feels like noise. Keep listening anyway.
    Noise → comprehensible speech over time.
    
    MISTAKE #3: Trying to memorize everything
    Don’t brute-force rules. Notice patterns in context.
    
    MISTAKE #4: Speaking too early
    Speak when you want, but prioritize comprehension first.
    
    MISTAKE #5: Staying in beginner content too long
    Move to content you actually enjoy once you know ~500 common words.
    
    MISTAKE #6: Using flashcards too much
    Input matters most: attitude + time + noticing.
    Vocabulary sticks through repeated context.
    
    CONCLUSION
    Avoid the 6 mistakes, but the key is finding time.

Subject Line: Why 90% of businesses fail…
Preview Text: And how you can avoid this

%FIRSTNAME%,

I want to get real with you for a moment.

In the last 10 years,

Over 34% of Americans considered starting a side hustle.

But what happened to most of the ones that did?

They spent months choosing a business model,

Watching mindset videos,

And meditating and taking cold showers instead of working.

They may believe they're making progress and promise to begin working tomorrow.

Except tomorrow turns into next week,

Which turns into next month,

And that results in 90% of people who start a side hustle failing within their first year.

This cycle even happened to me near the beginning of my YouTube journey,

But when I finally managed to make over $10k/mo,

I wanted to help others avoid wasting precious time like I did.

That's why I'll be hosting my F.R.E.E. YouTube Automation webinar.

It'll take place Wednesday, February 19 at 7 pm EST.

This'll be the last piece of content you'll need to watch.

I'll not only be sharing the most important information that allowed me to hit $10k/mo,

But also action steps for each tip.

So after watching the webinar,

You'll have all the information you need to get started.

Hope to see you there,

Subject Line: The YouTube Automation "secret"
Preview Text: Most people don't know about this…

"What if I stay broke forever?"

"How do these guys on YouTube make everything look so easy?"

"What if I'm just not good enough?"

That's what one of my students Ethan was telling me last year.

He'd been trying to grow his YouTube Automation channel for a few months,

But wasn't seeing much results despite staring at a screen all day.

To make things worse,

His family members and friends kept asking:

"How's that YouTube thing going?" 

He felt ashamed to explain that he hadn't made any money yet.

But after we started working together,

I taught him the "3-step AI autopilot" system for growing his channel.

It worked by first identifying the biggest trends,

Then using AI to help automate the video production process.

This way, he was able to spend less time creating videos that performed better.

The method didn't make him rich overnight.

But he took the right action steps every day no matter what.

As a result, he made over $4.5k last month,

And is well on his way to hitting 6-figures and making more than most people slaving away at their 9-5s.

Now %FIRSTNAME%, you might be thinking…

"What are the 3 steps of the method?"

Well, I'll be going over those on the F.R.E.E. YouTube Automation webinar.

I'll not only be explaining each part of the framework,

But I'll be giving 3 special bonuses to those who are there live to help them make progress even faster.

The training will be taking place in 3 days at the time this email was sent.

Subject Line: YouTube Automation is UNDERsaturated?
Preview Text: Here's the truth…

"YouTube is oversaturated,

You HAVE TO show your face,

And you need millions of views to start making money online."

That's what most people told me after finding out I started a YouTube channel.

But despite their comments,

I was able to create a faceless channel that made me $10k+/mo.

All without talking to a camera or having more than a few thousand subscribers.

But here's the crazier part…

<img src="images/email4.png" alt="Email 4 image" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:10px 0;">

I did this near the end of 2020,

When YouTube Automation was very popular.

The number of people currently trying this side hustle is lower than it has almost ever been.

If I could find success during a more 'saturated' time without any prior experience,

Most of you guys will easily be able to do the same.

"But <name>, how do I get started?"

Well, in my F.R.E.E. YouTube Automation webinar,

I'll be revealing everything I wish I knew when I first started, such as…

How to structure your videos to maximize watch time and engagement,
The best niches in 2025 to get the YouTube algorithm to promote your videos more,
How to use AI to automate the video-making process so you can effectively make passive income online.

And that's not even scratching the surface.

The webinar will happen on February 19 at 7 PM EST.

I've never done anything like this before,

So it's going to be incredibly valuable.

See you in 48 hours,

Rapport building

Hi! Okay, we are live. 

Can you guys hear me right now?

Put a "yes" in the chat if you can hear me right now.

Looks like most of you guys are saying yes, awesome!

Out of curiosity, where are you guys tuning in from?

Let me know in the chat.

[respond to comments about people's location]

Tease what's to come / Prove claims in advance

So in this free webinar today,

I'm going to show you how people are making over $10k/mo working less than 20 hours per week by creating YouTube channels from scratch. 

Specifically, I'll be showing you my 3-step "VCP" framework for creating a YouTube channel in 2025. 

This is the same method I used to quit my 9-5, 

And it's also how over 50 other people have been able to scale to 6 figures on YouTube quicker than with traditional methods. 

It has helped people like Carlos monetize his YouTube channel to be able to quit his day job as a plumber, 

Or Steven make over $8k/mo with YouTube while he was still in high school.

The first step of the "VCP" framework will show you how to reach the most people in the least amount of time. 

The second step will show how to get people to watch your videos the entire way through, 

And the third step will help you make the most amount of money possible from every view that you get.

Positioning herself as the expert.

But why should you listen to me? 

Well, my name is <name>, 

And I've managed to grow my YouTube channel to make over $100k/mo in passive income. 

But it didn't come without its difficulties. 

You see, after graduating from college,

I started working for Deloitte, one of the top consulting firms in the United States. 

The job paid well, 

But from the first day, 

I knew it wasn't for me. 

Having to go into the office every day at set hours was something I was never a fan of. 

I was living in New York at the time, 

And honestly, 

I hated it. 

It was too expensive and the winters were too cold. 

Since I was 13, 

I wanted to live in Madeira, a tropical island off the coast of Portugal. 

But with having to go to an office every day to do my job, I realized that with this path,

I'd never be able to live in my dream location. 

So I started looking for ways to make money online. 

I eventually stumbled across YouTube entrepreneurship. 

So I decided why not, I'll give it a chance. 

I put my head down and worked on my YouTube channel every minute that I wasn't at my consulting job. 

After 2 years, I scaled my channel to $10k/mo. 

I was able to quit the job I so strongly hated, 

Move to Madeira with my husband, 

And maintain the income while working 2-4 hours per day. 

I could spend the afternoons hanging out with friends or watching a movie with my family. 

It was all thanks to being a YouTube entrepreneur. 

Although it took me 2 years, 

I believe that if I were to start over, 

I could do it in as little as 6 months. 

My goal is to help people hit $10k/mo in less time than it took me by providing tips I wish I'd had when starting.

So now that you know a bit about me,

Are you guys ready to learn how you can grow a YouTube channel to generate 6-figures?

Let me know in the chat if you are!

Awesome!

Content

Now, before I dive into the VCP framework,

There are some common misconceptions many people have when it comes to starting a YouTube channel.

There's a good chance many of you guys may have some of these false impressions too.

I know because in the beginning,

I had several misunderstandings when it came to making money on YouTube,

And they held me back.

If I had known about them,

I would've reached my income goals much sooner.

So before I go in-depth on the VCP framework, 

I would like to share the 4 biggest myths that prevent people from reaching their full potential on YouTube.

The first myth is that you need the best equipment to get more views. 

It may be easy to think 'All the big Youtubers I watch have these elaborate set-ups, 

So I must need one too to get big.'

But here's the catch: 

They didn't have these premium setups in the beginning. 

If you look at some of their oldest videos, 

You'll see that almost all popular Youtubers started with barebones setups. 

No fancy greenscreens or high-quality editing, 

Just them in front of a blank wall talking to the camera. 

This shows that your setup doesn't need to be the best for you to start: 

It just needs to be good ENOUGH. 

Your video quality only needs to be good ENOUGH for people to see you clearly. 

Your sound quality only needs to be good ENOUGH for people to understand what you're saying. 

Your editing only needs to be good ENOUGH to make the video flow smoothly. 

As your channel grows and you start making money, 

You can upgrade the equipment you use if you'd like but don't think that you have to. 

For example, even after making over $100k/mo with YouTube, 

I still use my phone to record my videos, 

Just like I did at the start because I'm happy with its quality.

So that's the first one.

The second myth is that certain countries have advantages for growing on YouTube. 

A lot of people think it was easy for me to grow my channel because I grew up in the United States.

First of all, 

English wasn't my first language. 

Despite spending so much in the United States, 

I still have a noticeable accent when I speak. 

The other factor is this: 

The internet allows people from anywhere in the world to access any piece of information they'd like, 

And that essentially puts all countries on a level playing field. 

From Anatoly in Belarus to David in Argentina, 

I've had students from all around the world make over $10k/mo with YouTube. 

They didn't use any secret methods. 

They just followed the necessary steps and practiced communicating well. 

If they could do it, there's no reason you couldn't do it as well,

No matter what country you're from.

The third myth is that the best way to make money on YouTube is through ad revenue. 

When most people start YouTube channels, 

They want to get a lot of likes and views to increase the money they make from ads. 

This is what the path of a traditional "Youtuber" is like, 

But it's not the best strategy anymore because it takes much longer to make a full-time income. 

With less than 5k subscribers and barely 10k views at most per video, 

I was making $10k/mo on YouTube. 

But with traditional AdSense, 

You'd need between 800,000 and 5 million views per YouTube to even have a chance at making 5 figures per month. 

So what's the difference between me and traditional "Youtubers"? 

It's that I am a new-generation Youtuber, 

Also known as a "YouTube entrepreneur". 

Instead of focusing on the number of views I get, 

I care more about the quality of subscribers. 

My content is more educational than entertaining. 

And instead of making money through ads, 

I market and sell a separate product or service, 

Allowing me to generate more passive income than many channels that have 10x more subscribers than me.

The fourth myth is that making money on Youtube isn't possible anymore because Youtube is "oversaturated". 

Now this myth is only partially correct. 

Over 2 million hours of YouTube videos are uploaded each day, 

But ask yourself this: 

Why are so many people on YouTube in the first place? 

Well, it's because it's a good platform to grow and monetize an audience.

If YouTube wasn't a good option to make more money online, 

Then people wouldn't be using it as a viable strategy. 

So the vast ocean of content creators proves that YouTube works well to make money online, 

Hence why so many people are trying their hand at creating content. 

Introduction to the unique system

Here's the catch though. 

YouTube is an effective way to get rich,

But it's not easy. 

If it were, 

Then everybody who's on YouTube would be making millions. 

But while there are channels like Mr. Beast that make well over $50M every month, 

There are thousands of other channels making almost nothing. 

So to help you find success, 

I'm going to be sharing my tried-and-tested framework:

My "VCP" framework for anyone who wants to be a "YouTube entrepreneur".

VCP stands for visibility-consumability-profitability.

So starting with the first step, 

Visibility.

This is about getting people to find out about your channel.

You want to pick a niche that's profitable AND that you know a lot about. 

So while you may be knowledgeable about a subject like knitting, 

It's going to be very hard to find a large audience who will pay for you to teach them how to knit. 

I make videos about growing on YouTube because that is a topic I know a lot about, 

But it doesn't mean that's the only good option.

There are many other trending topics you could make content on.

And I'll reveal what they are in just a minute.

After picking a niche, 

You should start creating content. 

While doing so, 

You don't want just anybody to watch your videos. 

It's important to attract your ideal audience.

An ideal audience is interested in the subject you teach and is willing to spend the money to get better at it.

To attract them, your titles, thumbnails, and descriptions need to be appealing to the YouTube algorithm.

This means deeply researching your target audience and relevant SEO keywords.

But here's the thing…

It doesn't matter how many people you attract if no one watches your videos the entire way through.

If your engagement is low, then YouTube will stop showing your videos to people.

So how do you make sure your engagement is high?

Well, that takes me to the second step of the VCP framework, which is consumability.

People make judgments based on the first video they see from someone.

So what will make someone want to keep watching your videos?

If you develop a KLT with them. 

KLT is the know, like, and trust factor. 

If you can position yourself as an expert in the field, 

Someone who can answer all their questions and help them achieve their goals, 

Your audience will be more than ready to invest their time into you.

But how do you make people take the next step and eventually pay for your help?

Well, the third step of the VCP framework is profitability. 

Now that you've grown an audience that trusts you, 

And is willing to buy from you, 

The final step is to attract them to your offer without being overly pushy or salesy.

This requires some clever marketing.

You need to position your offer as the solution to their problems.

It's important to appeal to the current pains in their life,

And explain how you'll help get them to their dream state.

You want your product or service to give information not available in your YouTube videos,

Whether that's personalized coaching or some exclusive content that will help your audience.

So those are the 3-steps of the "VCP" framework to build a profitable channel.

Do all these things correctly and you're well on your way to growing your YouTube channel and achieving your financial and life goals:

Being able to live in a beautiful paradise if you'd like,

Spending ample time with your children, family, friends whenever you like,

Even going to the beach on a Tuesday afternoon while everyone else is working a 9-5.

That's what I was able to achieve thanks to my YouTube channel,

And I'm confident you guys will be able to do the same!

Anchor the Awesomeness

[with extremely high excitement here]

So just to recap,

You've learned how to start a successful YouTube without expensive equipment.

You know that you can become a successful YouTuber no matter what country you're from.

I've also taught you that the best monetization strategy on YouTube isn't through ad revenue,

But rather selling a program or course to help people.

And you now know how YouTube isn't an "oversaturated" platform to try and make money on.

Finally, I revealed my 3-step VCP framework so your channel gets more views,

More engagement,

And more purchases for your product. 

Acknowledgment of Value

I know that was a lot of information in a very short amount of time.

But was it helpful?

Did you guys understand the 4 myths I was talking about in the beginning?

Put a "YES" in the chat if what I said made sense.

What about my VCP framework?

Do you guys understand how that works?

Put a "YES" in the chat if you do.

And now,

Type "UNDERSTOOD" in the chat if you've found the information I've shared valuable so far.

Position the Offer as the Ultimate Solution

That's great, I'm glad you guys have enjoyed this so far.

To be honest,

I believe that with the information I've covered in this webinar today,

You could certainly accomplish some of your income goals.

And if that was the only option,

It would be a great one to pursue.

But what if there was another option?

One that allowed me to go deeper than we can in just 1 fast-moving hour.

What if I could play a role in your success and increase your chances of achieving your goals?

Do you think that in a situation where you had access to all the resources possible,

The odds would tremendously be in your favor?

If there were an option for me to give you all the personalized support necessary,

Would you love to hear more about it and what it can do for you?

[wait for the chat to give permission]

Great!

Close

That's why it's with great pleasure that I introduce you to The YouTube Intensive. 

Not only will you be getting 24/7 access to myself and my team to answer any questions you may have, 

But you'll also get access to all the resources and coaching possible. 

So what's inside The YouTube Intensive?

What they get

Well, in short, I give you all the personalized support you could need for each of the 3 steps of the VCP Framework.

For the first step: visibility.

To have success with this step,

You need to pick a niche that's profitable and that you're knowledgeable about.

In the YouTube Intensive,

Not only do I share what the best niches are, 

But I also help you decide which one you should pick based on your interests and areas of knowledge.

I'll also be showing you how to position your channel and write the best titles, thumbnails, and descriptions so the YouTube algorithm promotes your videos to the right group of people.

The second step is consumability,

Which is all about engaging your audience.

In the YouTube Intensive, 

I teach how you can optimize your KLT positioning based on your specific audience and brand voice.

The way you present yourself as an authority can vary depending on the niche you're in.

In the program, I'll specifically go over what makes people see others as authorities,

And how you can use psychology so your viewers view you in the same way based on your niche.

This way, your viewers will know, like, and trust you in the shortest amount of time.

Then for the 3rd step: profitability.

Inside The YouTube Intensive,

I discuss the best marketing techniques to get a stream of qualified leads to work with. 

You'll also learn the best types of products and offers to create based on your personal brand.

Now, if you present your product too early,

It'll be salesy and your audience may stop watching your content.

If you present it too late, the audience may have already invested in someone else's product.

To make sure you get the timing right,

I'll also be teaching when and how you should present your product to your target audience to warm them up over time.

If that all sounds interesting to you,

I'm going to officially drop the link in the chat to apply now.

What free bonuses they get

I know I've explained a lot,

So to reward you guys who've gotten this far into the live webinar,

I'll be offering 3 free bonuses when you enroll.

But first, I have to make a quick disclaimer:

While being on YouTube can bring you success, 

There's one common pitfall you need to avoid, 

And that is copying someone else's format for creating videos. 

I did this for the first 3 months of my YouTube journey, 

And it was a complete waste of time. 

Think of it this way: 

If I created shoes with the same white checkmark that Nike has, 

And tried to sell them, 

Would anybody buy them from me? 

No, of course not. 

Even if my shoes use the most comfortable fabric in the world, 

I still wouldn't sell any. 

Why? 

Because people don't buy Nike shoes because they like how the check mark looks. 

They buy because the check represents a prestigious brand that hundreds of athletes preach to get good results. 

In the same way, 

A YouTuber with over 10 million subscribers doesn't just run a successful channel. 

He's created a brand for himself, 

So copying him won't work for you. 

Instead, 

You should analyze their content and monetization system and understand why it works to generate views and dollars. 

Then take the principles and apply them to your own channel in a unique way. 

Doing this ensures that you use the best strategies without being a copy-paste channel.

Now, if you're extremely intelligent and have a keen eye for these kinds of social media trends, 

Then you may be able to figure out the principles on your own. 

But for the majority of people, 

Myself included when first starting, 

It's difficult to notice these kinds of patterns immediately. 

That's why as a bonus, 

You'll get my "100 paths to $100k swipe file".

It's a guide with 100 of the most successful types of YouTube videos.

I've analyzed the best-performing videos of the largest educational channels and my most successful students,

And I compiled this list for you.

This way, you won't have to waste time figuring out how to create a profitable system for your channel, 

And can instead immediately start testing out different templates to see which one works best for you.

It took the team and I several months to do this,

But you'll get it for completely free when you join The YouTube Intensive!

And that's just the first of the 3 bonuses.

Additionally, you'll also get my "2-hour personal brand course".

You'll learn the 20 fundamentals that make up every successful online brand based on data that I and my team have gathered. 

The course will also teach you how to implement them into your brand to grow and monetize it as soon as possible.

And now the third and final bonus is my "$100M AI Toolkit".

My team and I once again did hours of research to put this together.

Once you've started making some progress with your channel and your time becomes the limiting factor,

This'll be the perfect tool for you.

It has a list of over 30 AI tools you can use to help you come up with video ideas, write scripts, and so many other functionalities.

Once you've started scaling your income,

You can use these tools to automate more of your work.

This way, you can make more money while working less.

So those are the 3 bonuses:

The "100 paths to $100k swipe file", the "2-hour personal brand course", and the "$100M AI Toolkit".

I usually sell each of these on their own.

But since I want to make The YouTube Intensive the only program you'll need to become successful on YouTube,

All those programs will be included when you enroll at no additional cost.

In case you missed it the previous time,

Here's the link to apply for The YouTube Intensive.

Here on the screen, you can see all the things that are included when you join.

So now, I want all of you in the chat…

Type "YES" if you're feeling motivated and ready to start making money on YouTube.

Great! I'll drop the link once again for you to join.

What they risk/lose out on due to inaction

Now, to all the people who are serious about YouTube,

I want to end off by presenting you with two options: 

You can either join a community of passionate learners with all your next steps laid out at every stage of the process, 

Where if you take advantage of it, 

You may end up like Ethan, 

Who managed to scale his Youtube channel to over $18k/mo in just 9 months thanks to the resources provided to him. 

OR

Your other option is to try figuring all this out on your own, 

Which may take months or even years longer. 

As Alex Hormozi said, 

"You're paying the universe $1,000,000 every year for not knowing how to make $1,000,000 yourself." 

Social media algorithms and trends can change as often as every couple of weeks. 

You could try keeping up with all these changes yourself, 

Or join the Youtube Intensive, 

Where you'll be told exactly what the most recent changes are and how to adapt to them.  

With the resources provided, 

You're practically guaranteed to reach $10k/mo in months or even years faster than otherwise. 

But I have to warn you: 

Because of the intensity of the program, 

My team and I can only accept up to 75 people. 

After these 75 spots fill up, 

If you want to join, 

You'll have to wait until the next cycle starts, 

Which could take a few months.

So if you want to ensure your best chances of succeeding on YouTube,

Click the link in the chat to apply for The YouTube Intensive. 

And with all that being said,

I can't wait to see you all inside and help you on your YouTube journey!</pre>

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

The webinar was insane.

Hundreds of people showed up,

Were blown away by the value provided,

And were super motivated.

Everyone was spamming the chat saying how excited they were to start creating YouTube videos.

And I couldn't be happier for everyone who joined me.

If you missed out, don't worry.

You still have some time.

Here's the replay of the webinar.

But I have to warn you:

Most people don't teach the blueprint I shared in paid courses,

Let alone free webinars.

So to avoid other coaches ripping this off,

I'll be taking the replay down 72 hours from now.

So watch it while you can.

And as promised…

Here are your 3 special bonuses:

✅ Gift #1: The Plug-and-play Video Script Template you can use to create winning videos.

✅ Gift #2: The YouTube Growth Tracker to measure your metrics and make optimal decisions.

✅ Gift #3: The Ultimate Toolkit with the exact AI tools I use to automate my video production.

These gifts will give you a massive head start on your wealth journey,

So I hope you take full advantage of them.

Best,

Matt.

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

I saw that you signed up for my faceless AI YouTube channel webinar.

If you couldn't attend or you missed part of it,

It's not a problem.

Life happens sometimes.

That's why I recorded the whole class for you.

I didn't want anyone to miss out on the hidden gems I revealed.

Throughout the webinar, I discussed

The 3-step process to monetize a faceless YouTube channel.
The types of videos to upload to boost your chances of going viral.
How to use AI to automate video production.

…And so much more.

Since you registered for the webinar in advance,

I decided to give you access to the recording as a gift.

Here's a link to the replay.

Here's the thing though…

People who procrastinate on important tasks are unlikely to find success.

Because of this,

I want to reward people who take action as soon as possible.

So I'll be taking down the recording 48 hours from now.

You don't want to be kicking yourself later for missing your chance,

So grab a bucket of popcorn, 

Find a comfy chair, 

And start watching the replay.

I know you'll gain immense value from it.

Hope you enjoy it.

Best,

Matt.

Subject Line: The biggest reason people fail at YouTube
Preview Text: How to make sure you're not one of them…

Of the 51M channels on YouTube,

Less than 4% of them are making 6-figures.

In fact, most people never even make a dime on YouTube.

And it's not because they're in the wrong niche,

Not smart enough,

Or "unlucky".

Instead, they probably fell into this one trap that prevented them from scaling their channels.

Avoiding this mistake could be the difference between success and failure.

I'm talking about not having a strategy to improve your metrics. 

It might not seem like a big deal,

But having a proper system can make a big difference…

In my webinar, I provided all the tools you need to make a 6-figure income on YouTube.

There's one more thing you need to understand though…

When you first create your channel,

You may not immediately get thousands of views.

But here's the thing…

The platform won't tell you the reason why.

Maybe your thumbnails aren't intriguing.

Maybe your titles don't appeal to the YouTube algorithm.

Maybe the videos themselves are boring.

The truth is…

It can be difficult to figure out the reason by yourself.

It's possible,

But it will likely be longer than necessary.

The solution to this problem? 

To have an expert help you,

Someone who faced and went through all the problems you might have.

With a mentor to guide you at every point,

You'll be able to fix your mistakes and grow your channel faster.

So %FIRSTNAME%,

If you're interested in the idea of having a professional work with you to help you start making money quicker,

After you apply,

My team will analyze your current situation, see if we can help you, and go from there.

Subject Line: 16-year-old makes $14k while sleeping
Preview Text: Here's how…

Hey %FIRSTNAME%,

Despite the hundreds of success stories,

Many beginners still wonder if YouTube Automation will work for them.

So I wanted to share a big win that'll motivate you to eliminate your limiting beliefs and reach your income goals.

Meet Dylan.

He was 16 years old when he started creating faceless videos.

Check out how one of them is doing now:

<img src="images/email5.png" alt="Email 5 image" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:10px 0;">


After publishing the video,

He was able to make almost $14k without lifting a finger.

How did he do it?

Well, in Dylan's own words,

He managed to become a YouTube grandmaster in 3 simple steps:

Step 1: Worked consistently each day whether he felt like it or not.

Step 2: Invested in coaching so he could skip the pitfalls and take the fast lane to a profitable channel.

Step 3: Applied the expert advice he received at every possible opportunity.

That's all it takes.

You don't need to be some video professional.

You just need to focus on what works instead of wasting time on fluff.

So let me ask you a question %FIRSTNAME%...

If just one investment could result in you making 5-figures with a single video,

Would it be worth it?

If you answered 'yes',

And you'd like access to the same tools, coaches, and community Dylan used to make $14k with a single video,

Subject Line: Get rich on YouTube with real estate
Preview Text: Not what you think…

%FIRSTNAME%,

Is real estate a good investment in 2025?

Now, you might be wondering:

'Why is a YouTube Automation coach talking about real estate?'

It's a valid question,

But hear me out and you'll understand.

I don't think buying real estate is the best investment option,

At least not in the traditional sense.

I recently bought a $1M house,

But my favorite real estate asset is my digital ones, which include my YouTube channels.

They provide me with passive income and appreciate over time like conventional properties.

But unlike traditional real estate,

There are practically no starting costs.

It's also much less risky because you don't have to deal with stubborn clients or expensive repairs.

But like traditional real estate,

It can be tough to figure out by yourself.

Creating an empire is quite complex.

The laws and strategies around them change all the time.

Because of this,

It's important to find a way to stay updated on the trends.

Sure, you can try watching YouTube Automation videos online,

But because the trends change so often,

The strategies they discuss are oftentimes outdated.

It can also be difficult for a beginner to figure this out on their own.

But there's one type of person who can easily understand the trends…

An expert.

Someone with years of experience in this field can identify patterns quickly.

With their help,

You'll always be updated on which strategies are working best.
